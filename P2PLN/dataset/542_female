Following my post about male breast cancer, I have had a considerable number of emails from men who have been affected by the disease. All of them agree that the diagnosis came as a double shock to them - as they did not know that the disease could appear in men. In all cases the breast cancer was found at a much later stage because men hesitate too long before seeking medical advice. Women are much more in tune with their bodies and notice much quicker when anything seems amiss.I have been contacted by an organisation called Out of the Shadow of Pink, which was created by an American lady, Cathy Reid, when her husband was diagnosed with Stage 4 male breast cancer.Sadly, he died in 2008 after fighting the disease for three years. Cathy continues to raise awareness of male breast cancer and there is pending legislation in the United States to create the third week of October as Male Breast Cancer Awareness Week.She is trying for a similar day or week here but, when I logged on to the e-petition on the No. 10 website, I discovered only five signatures and the petition out of time. It is imperative that we  promote awareness of this disease and create support networks. Should we try and petition again?Cathy says that in 2005 - which is hardly any time ago - there was no information in the USA about male breast cancer. Breakthrough Breast Cancer is doing sterling work in this country - perhaps they could join forces with Out of the Shadow of Pink and lobby our government.On a more positive note - Breast Cancer Care has male volunteers who answer telephone queries.  So - if there are any men out there who are concerned as to whether or not to bother the doctor, or who are embarrassed, please call Breast Cancer Care on 020 7960 0000 and speak to a fellow member of your sex.  Do not assume the symptoms are to do with age, will go away on their own, or could not possibly be linked to male breast cancer.  Seek medical advice now.
