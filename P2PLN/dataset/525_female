We are moving towards the end of Breast Cancer Awareness Month and I have taken to heart the many comments and emails I have received from men who feel that cancers affecting them (particularly prostate cancer) are not receiving the amount of media attention that is granted to the breast cancer charities.I intend fully to address this issue in November.Meanwhile, on Thursday of this week - 27th October - Macmillan Cancer Care has teamed up with Avon Cosmetics and they are offering a live web chat with a breast cancer nurse specialist. Angela Sheldrick is based at the Milton Keynes NHS Foundation Trust and will be available at 1 pm to answer any questions on the subject of breast cancer.If you would like to follow the chat session, log onto www.avonconnects.co.uk. Should you have a question for Nurse Angela, there is a simple log on procedure after which you can add your question - but please remember that it can be read by everyone who has accessed the site. To see new contributions, simply refresh the page.Since 1992, when Avon UK launched its Breast Cancer Crusade, it has raised over Â£15 million for charities including Breakthrough Breast Cancer, Macmillan Cancer Support and Crazy Hats Breast Cancer Appeal. Avon Cosmetics also funds a Macmillan Secondary Breast Cancer Nurse Specialist who works in WarwickshireMacmillan is hoping that the live web chat will encourage people who have concerns - but do not feel able to visit their GP - to ask their questions in the comfort and privacy of their own homes.
