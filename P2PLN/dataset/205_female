Landlords and real estate agents are rubbing their hands together at a sudden rush for holiday bookings, with many spots along the east coast already booked out for the two most popular weeks of summer.   Angus Raine, chief executive of Raine  Horne, says Byron Bay property is almost fully booked for the week around New Year's Eve, and to the north, the Gold Coast is attracting families again with occupancy rates from Christmas Eve until the end of Januaryedging towards 95 per cent.Clark Brackenridge, principal of Raine  Horne Surfers Paradise, says it's a welcome change."This is a significant improvement on last summer, where occupancy rates of 80 percent were the norm," he says.On the NSW south coast bookings are up 30 per cent on last year, Raine says.Jo Dunmall, a letting agent with First National Real Estate Ulladulla, has only a handful of properties left and most have been booked out since June.While Dunmall says the recent enquiry level has been "hectic" and she is having to turn many people away, she says that is quite normal for this time of year.However, Raine says there is a stronger-than-usual demand for domestic holidays."When the Australian dollar climbed above parity not so long ago, it encouraged many to fast-track their plans to travel abroad," says Raine."But now as a consequence, more Aussies are staying home this year."Along Victoria's coast a reasonably two reasonably good summers in a row means there is plenty of repeat business for real estate agency Great Ocean Road Holidays.Holiday accommodation manager Matthew Neill says the Christmas and New Year period booked out a few months ago, and the rest of the summer break is tracking well with 75-80 per cent of properties expected to book out.In Byron Bay, Raine  Horne Byron Bay principal Sophie Christou says there are still properties available for the week of Christmas.Byron Bay is popular with holidaymakers from Sydney and Melbourne, according to Christou, as well as visitors from New Zealand. Christou says two-bedroom holiday apartments start from $2000 a week in Byron Bay during the festive season.
