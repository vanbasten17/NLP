Who would have thought an Australian fibro house could be one of the most energy-efficient in the world?Traditionally known as freezing cold in winter and stinking hot in summer, the humble fibro is probably one of the last abodes likely to win an award for energy efficiency. But this week an Australian team took out the Solar Decathlon 2013 award for just that, beating 19 other entries from around the world.The winning team retrofitted a 1960s suburban fibro to make it a net-zero energy user, adding solar panels to the roof, a combined solar panel and air heating system, and greywater recycling that uses an artificial wetland designed into the garden to filter the water. The home produces more energy than it uses.The 50 students and staff from the University of Wollongong and Illawarra TAFE spent 18 months working on the project. They named the house in honour of the spectacular Illawarra Flame Tree, which "renews itself, blossoming into a thing of beauty".The biennial competition isn't just about who can use the latest technology - the ten judging points include market appeal, thermal comfort and architecture.The team says they chose to upgrade an existing home rather than design from scratch as it helps to solve the problem of what to do with Australia's ageing housing stock and a population that largely wants to remain in-situ into their later years. They figured as people age, the original modest house size of the Aussie fibro, with modifications such as converting the third bedroom into a living space to make it more open plan and usable, could be just what empty-nesters need.Key features of the  were replacing the dangerous asbestos exterior with a modern cladding, modifying the roofline to allow high-set clerestory windows to bring in extra light and air, and adding decks on the north and south of the home to let the homeowner to better harness the sun and shade in different seasons.The group increased the home's insulation to R6.0.Â  They replaced the windows with timber-framed double-glazed units to increase air tightness and reduce the heating and cooling losses that occur through conventional single-pane glass with aluminium frames.The solar system on the house is a 9.4 kilowatt array split between conventional poly-crystalline solar panels and thin-film panels that have a photovoltaic thermal (PVT) air system that removes hot air from underneath the panels, increasing the electrical efficiency of the panels and providing space heating in winter and radiant cooling in summer.The hot water system is driven by a solar array of 30 evacuated tubes on the roof that heat water stored in a hot water tank.The team combatted the lack of thermal mass in a traditional fibro by adding an attractive internal wall of dense panels made from 90 per cent recycled content, including crushed terracotta roof tiles from the original house, recycled glass and a low-carbon cement mixture. The wall aids temperature regulation in the home as it is warmed by the sun entering through the windows in winter but remains cool in summer when the home's eaves shade the interior.The property's lights were replaced with LED globes, and a rewire of the house included a non-priority line allowing all standby items to be easily switched off when they are not needed.The interior of the home contained furniture from the 1960s, which was sanded back and reupholstered.The team had to pack and rebuild the house three times, most recently on location in China where the finals were held.Many of the people looking through the home commented on just how beautiful it looks - very surprising indeed for an old Aussie fibro.
