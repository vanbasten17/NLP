Private sector growth across the eurozone has slowed this month, bringing job creation to a standstill and dampening hopes that Europe's weak economy will rebound robustly from its recent stagnation.The latest monthly index of purchasing managers (PMI), from data firm Markit, found that France's economy continues to struggle. French manufacturing activity is falling at its fastest rate in 15 months. Growth in the country's service sector picked up, but the overall French private sector is flatlining after shrinking for the past three months.The composite PMI for the eurozone fell to a two-month low of 52.8 this month, down from 53.8 in July. Factory output weakened, with the eurozone manufacturing PMI falling to a 13-month low of 50.8, closer to the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction.Firms also reported that job creation had slowed to near-stagnation in August, suggesting that progress in cutting eurozone unemployment is stalling."The ongoing subdued and fragile nature of the upturn in economic activity also remains too weak to encourage companies to take on staff in sufficiently large numbers to have a meaningful impact on unemployment," Markit said, warning that economic and geopolitical uncertainties are also deterring firms from hiring.Concerns over the eurozone have risen, after figures last week showed that the economy stagnated in the April to June quarter, with German GDP shrinking by 0.2%. August's PMIs suggest that the eurozone will only manage modest growth in the third quarter of 2014."The region remains on course to register growth of only around 0.3%-0.4% in the third quarter, a level that is unlikely to stimulate any real turnaround in the labour market," warned Rob Dobson of Markit.City economists said the PMIs added to the pressure on the European Central Bank to do more to stimulate the eurozone economy, perhaps through a large quantitative easing programme.The ECB president, Mario Draghi, is due to speak at the Jackson Hole symposium of central bankers in Wyoming on Friday.The data also showed divergence between the eurozone's two largest economies. Output in Germany rose for the 16th month in a row in August, but merely stabilised in France after contracting since May.Germany also saw a modest gain in employee numbers, while France had the steepest pace of job losses since February. Germany's composite output index fell to a two-month low of 54.9, still high enough to suggest steady growth this quarter."There were concerns that the German economy was going to suffer because of Ukraine, but today's data shows that the economy is going to keep on growing," said Koen De Leus, senior economist at KBC.Separate data from HSBC showed that Chinese factory growth has slowed to a three-month low, with new-order growth dropping. Hongbin Qu, HSBC's chief economist for China, said Beijing should supply more policy support to help consolidate the recovery.America's factory sector appears to be growing strongly this month: the US manufacturing PMI jumped to 58.0, the highest reading since April 2010, as companies put last winter's slowdown behind them.
