U.S. Women's Soccer is light years from the popularity of the NFL, so perhaps you've missed the domestic violence charges against super-goalie Hope Solo. They don't differ much from what's going on with several NFL stars.Solo, who just last week missed the chance to break a world goalkeeping shutout record, is a soccer darling. So much so, apparently, that U.S. Soccer doesn't have much to say about the  misdemeanor domestic violence charges against her in an alleged assault of her half-sister and 17-year-old nephew last summer in Washington."We are aware that Hope is handling a personal situation at the moment," said Neil Buethe, U.S. Soccer director of communications, told USA Today's Christine Brennan, who has had a couple of strong columns just in the past week on this issue here and here.Brennan makes a great point in her recent column on Solo: "She has been convicted of no crimes, but neither was Michael Phelps when USA Swimming suspended him for three months in 2009 after a picture surfaced of him smoking a marijuana pipe."It's not a news flash that perpetrators of domestic violence are not all men. But the Hope Solo story shows again the lack of consistency when it comes to sports stars' off-the-field behavior.
