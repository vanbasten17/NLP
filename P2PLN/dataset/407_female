There are many thousands of people in Britain living with and beyond breast cancer - over 48,000 people, of whom the vast majority are women, are diagnosed each year - and, for them, the disease can have long-lasting effects on their physical and emotional well-being. Breast cancer - any cancer - can take over the lives of the patient, as well as his or her family and friends.I know just how difficult it is to "compartmentalise" and shut the cancer firmly into a box at the back of your mind. Try as you might, there is a definite "jack-in-the-box" element which makes it pop up at any time - usually when you are least expecting it - and, even after nearly four years, I have moments of overwhelming emotion which arrive from nowhere.Breast Cancer Care surveyed 427 women and found that, up to five years after treatment, 45 per cent said they still thought about their breast cancer every day. So - for many people - living with and beyond breast cancer requires support in order to understand and cope with complex emotions and physical concerns which might lower their quality of life.The same survey found that, in the year after treatment, 92 per cent of the 427 women needed information and advice beyond that offered by their hospital consultant; after 5 years, 63 per cent said their breast cancer still negatively impacted on their sex lives and 66 per cent felt that family and friends had moved on after a year - while they were still unable to do so.With this need in mind, Breast Cancer Care has just unveiled its first major advertising campaign. Called "Support for the woman behind the cancer", it is a poster and video campaign. Both M C Saachi and The Mill, who produced it, worked pro bono. The celebrated photographer, Julia Fullerton-Batten, has focused on another part of her "world of women" and produced a striking image to illustrate how the world thinks of a woman with breast cancer.For those with access to Facebook, BliNQ Media (also working pro bono) is coordinating a campaign of Sponsored Stories - www.facebook.com/breastcancercare - and if you log onto www.breastcancercare.org.uk/thewoman you will find guest bloggers who describe their own experiences with the disease. You'll also be able to view the video and leave a message as to why you "support the woman behind the cancer".While the aim is, obviously, to persuade people to donate to the charity, it is hoped that the campaign will draw those in need to the website, where they will find the full range of services offered by the charity - before, during and after treatment.The (Breast Cancer) Haven is another charity which works tirelessly to offer breast cancer sufferers a place of peace to which they can go and where they will find therapists, breast cancer nurses and (thanks to a large donation from Walk the Walk) the number of free one-on-one complementary therapy sessions has risen to 10. The list on the website covers a multitude of therapies, support groups, movement classes etc - all of which focus on "life not cancer" and mirrors "Support for the woman behind the cancer".There are three Havens - London, Leeds and Hereford - and, this year, The Haven is offering outreach days for those who cannot make the journey to one of the centres. The next outreach day will be 6th March in Bristol. Another is planned for Swindon in April or May. Keep an eye on the Haven's website - www.thehaven.org.uk - for updates about that and all the other support they offer.Working alongside your medical team, time spent at The Haven (with or without family and friends) enables you to understand the importance of eating healthily, learn the techniques of relaxation and return to leading an active life. The supported self-management offered by all at The Haven, helps you to step out of the shadow of breast cancer and back into the world - with the confidence of knowing that you can visit the Haven at any time for the rest of your life.Why do I "support the woman behind the cancer" and believe that "the focus should be on life not cancer"? Because - having experienced it myself, having seen far too many friends suffer from different forms of cancer and having been surprised at the varied responses of family and friends, I feel strongly that too many people confuse the disease with the person; too many people take too little time to understand the complexities of the disease and its effect on the person; too many people write off the person, seeing only the cancer but others expect too swift a recovery.Charities like Breast Cancer Care and The Haven are working to put that right. Sami al Qadhi, CEO of Breast Cancer Care, says that in 2010, the charity had three million requests for support.Once again, we look to our charities to support the patient. If organisations like NHS Improvement spent less time talking about "better journeys" for the patient and more time actively accompanying patients on those journeys and then not abandoning them at their destination, there might not be so many people searching for help.
