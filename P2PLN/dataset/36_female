Follow @SharonFGrigsbySlate's Brian Palmer (whose job title is "chief explainer") must be related to our own Rodger Jones somewhere back in their family trees. The level of detail he crunched down into (i.e. he was really in the weeds) in order to answer the question: "Which City Has the Worst Drivers?"is similar to Rodger's never-say-die digging.For those of you who don't want to wade through Palmer's lengthy explanation of how he made his analysis as ironclad as possible, here are the money graphs from his list of cities in which to avoid driving your car: (With three of the five coming out of Florida, perhaps colleague Ralph De La Cruz can offer some insight.)5: Baltimore. Baltimoreans just can't keep from running into each other. They were outside the top 10 in fatalities, DWI deaths, and pedestrian strikes, but their rate of collision couldn't keep them out of the top five overall.I'm pleased to report that the only mention I could find of a Texas city was Garland, which was at the top of the list in number of miles that members of an average household travel by car in a year (19,234 miles).Given the frequency of headlines like this one yesterday out of North Texas, I can only imagine what the Metro Briefs look like in these Top 5 cities.
