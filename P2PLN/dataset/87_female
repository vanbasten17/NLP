As a distance runner who has had the chance to compete in exciting — and large — marathons and half marathons, I can vouch for the fact that it's the spectators that keep us non-elite runners motivated when the going gets tough. They line the streets with their sweet and irreverent signs, cheering for everyone, not just the family member or friend whom they are really there to see. And the most motivating of all the crowd are the young children, who stand so patiently and so excitedly, virtually dancing with joy over all of the hubbub.At present, it's hard to imagine ever running in a race again without imagining Martin Richard's face. Martin is the 8-year-old third-grader who loved baseball, riding his bike and cheering on friends at the Boston Marathon. And as probably everyone knows by now, he's one of three dead in yesterday's twin bombings. His mother and sister were horribly injured in the attack.I know that every life lost is a precious one, but Martin's face is haunting me today — why are we human beings so inhumane to one another, especially to our innocent children? Just a few months ago at Newtown and now here at the Boston marathon. Hard to find any perspective to all this evil.
