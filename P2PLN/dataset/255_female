If there's one thing guaranteed to cause arguments, it's renovations.Aside from the disruption of having tradies traipse through your home, the confusion over whether certain facts were actually communicated, and the sharp sense of unease watching the bank balance shrink, the biggest bone of contention has to be the vast array of choices.We've gotten through bathroom taps, the toilet, the hand basin and what to cover the floor with. But the showstopper this week was something seemingly innocuous - the door.The statement "I've ordered the door", was met with stony silence. On one side of the fence is the argument for a bog-standard single-pane glass entry door that lets in plenty of light and garden views, but also heat and cold.On the other is the desire for, at the very least, double-glazing, preferably with a low-emissivity (low-e) coating on one face to make the set-up more efficient.Both sides of the fence are happy with a timber frame, which although requires more maintenance, suits the style of the house and is more energy efficient than standard aluminium.The main sticking point is the price difference of the two different glazing options (several hundred dollars at most suppliers), and the fact that, as most companies don't offer double-glazing as standard, it will throw the wait-time for the door out past Christmas.For all the talk of building more energy-efficient homes, it seems most suppliers are still playing catch up. Few have off-the-shelf double-glazed doors, and those that do, stock them in limited sizes.One company I contacted this week said they used to do a double-glazed unit, but found the double-glazing didn't fit their doors so now they only offer single glazed.Argh!!While the argument is not yet settled on the domestic front, and the door deposit has not actually been paid, there has been plenty of reading of the Window Energy Rating Scheme (WERS) , in  and the window comparison tool on the .Real world discussions and workings from the Alternative Technology Association These sites are helpful in working out what, in an ideal world, would be the best solution for a property in a given area. And the efficient glazing tool gives some indication of the expected pay-off period of converting all of a home's windows to a different type of frame and/or glazing.What most don't tell you is the improved comfort factor, which is often hard to put a price on.For too long in Australia we've been blessed to live in a mild climate but build homes that make us feel in winter as though we are in eye of a constant snowstorm. And in the summer, you only need to wander around the suburbs and see the air-conditioners churning to see how poorly most of our homes still perform.Perhaps we're in line for a revolution on doors and windows though.Just a few years ago it was a struggle to find a six-star WELS-rated tap, or a decent low-flow shower. But now they are wall-to-wall in most bathroom stores, and at reasonable prices.Ditto water-efficient toilets, low-VOC paints and bamboo products, which have become the norm. And just in the last few months LED light globes have begun to take up serious shelf space at national hardware stores.Let's hope it's not too far off until more energy-efficient windows and doors become a regular offering at more reasonable prices. That just might mean lower energy bills, greater comfort, and a bit less angst at renovation time.
