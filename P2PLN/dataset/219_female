The number of properties expected to go under the hammer in Melbourne and Sydney is hurtling towards record highs.While the peak numbers being predicted vary from analyst to analyst, there's general agreement that after the October long weekend there will be a surge in properties selling via auction.Dr Andrew Wilson, the senior economist at Australian Property Monitors (a Fairfax Media company) says the market could peak with 1200 auctions in Melbourne and 700 in Sydney, near records for both capitals.The Melbourne market will be affected by spikes as vendors shuffle dates of avoid the AFL grand final weekend this weekend and the Melbourne Cup week, which kicks off with Derby Day on Saturday November 2.In Sydney, Damien Cooley, of Cooley Auctions, is predicting auction numbers could smash previous highs and reach more than 800 in the harbour city on at least one Saturday before the year is out."Our numbers tend to represent about 10-12 per cent of a Saturday market and our record is 86 auctions," Cooley explains."On October 12 we're already nudging that figure and it wouldn't surprise me to see our business crack 100 auctions on an upcoming Saturday this Spring."This weekend, there are 593 auctions scheduled for Sydney but just 47 planned in Melbourne due to the AFL grand final.Cooley says auction numbers should build throughout November and peak anywhere from the middle to the end of that month.The big question many vendors are asking is should they wait until next year to sell or jump now.Wilson says the market may well come back strong post-Christmas, but if current economic forecasts come to fruition, cooling winds could be blowing later next year."If the economic fundamentals pan out as they're predicted over the next nine months, then that will have a tapering effect on housing market activity," Wilson says."I still believe we will get quite a solid strong result in most housing markets through the financial year ending June next year but I think the strongest part of that market will be this year rather than next year."Already in Melbourne, a market playing catch-up to previous price highs, there may be an element of "getting in now while the market is hot", Wilson says.In Sydney's inner east and west, Ivan Bresic, director and auctioneer at BresicWhitney Estate Agents, has noticed a slight change in the volume of buyers coming through his doors since the election."There has been little bit less enquiry and a few buyers are a bit less enthused about the heat of the market so they're dropping out," Bresic says."Don't get me wrong, there's buyers, there's activity, as there has been all year, but I've just started to see some chinks in the armour where a few buyers are starting to say 'it's a bit too heated, I'm going to go rent for a bit'. We didn't see that a month ago. I think we'll see a bit more of that."Bresic believes that the inner city areas often experience market trends first. "Agents might not say that in Melbourne or in Mosman or in Palm Beach or in Broadbeach yet, but they will because we seem to feel it quicker than everyone else," he says.For buyers Wilson says higher auction volumes will provide more choice but as sellers tend to also be buyers, there will be heightened competition in the market."The majority of the market is that changeover type of buyer so they'll be affected by both ends of the stick," he says.
