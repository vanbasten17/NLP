The changes in the bill are confusing. Talking to other students, most are not sure what it means. My concern is that letting private companies into the NHS might change the equal care that we give to everyone.I like the principle that clinicians are making the decisions on care - but the fact that so many doctors are against it, and feel they are not being properly consulted, concerns me.A lot of my friends plan to be GPs later in their careers. But as medical students we're not trained in business or managing money - it's scary to think this might be part of our jobs in the future.
