The Associated Press announced today that it will no longer use the term "illegal immigrant.""The Stylebook no longer sanctions the term 'illegal immigrant' or the use of 'illegal' to describe a person," Kathleen Carroll, AP's senior VP and executive editor, said, explaining the decision. "Instead, it tells users that 'illegal' should describe only an action, such as living in or immigrating to a country illegally."Carroll said the move was made to be consistent with the new organization's effort to rid the Stylebook of labels.The New York Times says it is considering something similar. Slate has an interesting piece on how the AP decision was made.I will be curious to see what our newspaper does. We generally follow AP style, so I assume we too will drop "illegal" in the case of "illegal immigrant."With progress on comprehensive immigration reform gaining momentum this year,Â  I suspect some opponents will be wailing about the liberal media's latest "coddling" of those who enter the country illegally.UPDATE: The DMN newsroom reports: "Our style committee is taking a look at the new AP style entry, but it's definitely not a sure thing that we'll follow their style."
