	So the blond is going to spend seven months in the can for stalking. Terrific. Or maybe not so much.
	Would the same sentence have been imposed if Alec Baldwin hadn't been a movie star? Probably not. See, if you're a regular person being stalked you can count on justice too — but after you're killed, assaulted, maimed or raped.
	According to a recent study, despite anti-stalking laws in every state, relatively few stalkers are cited or arrested! Well, unless they're stupid enough to stalk a celebrity, that is.
	For celebrity stalkers, justice is quick and tough — even if, like Baldwin, all the star has suffered is the aggravation of unwanted contact — from someone he probably did sleep with. Once.
	Baldwin must be one helluva of guy. He's now caused two blonds to go nuts: Genevieve Sabourin from a one-night stand and ex-wife Kim Basinger from 10 years of marriage.
	Isn't there some sort of law against driving more than one blond insane?
	Thank God his child bride is a brunette.
	Look, I'm not saying Baldwin didn't suffer. But it was mostly from being annoyed as hell by Sabourin. Seven months in jail — seriously? The woman should be in a straightjacket, not in handcuffs.
	By comparison, one of my half-dozen stalkers had physically assaulted four joggers before he found me, and even grabbed one woman off the street on Queens Blvd. and tried to beat her senseless. He got zero time from a kindly judge.
	But this is now, and Baldwin, a rage-aholic who assaults photographers as often as the rest of us eat lunch, has never had to do time for it.
	What can you call a guy once his ex-Basinger already called him "Saddam Hussein?" I hear Hussein took great offense.
