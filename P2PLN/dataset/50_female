First, a hearty "ditto" from me to colleague Tod Robberson's blog post of several hours ago headlined "Dallas Ebola patient's death underscores why rapid response makes a difference."We are still missing an awful lot of the facts about exactly what happened when Thomas Eric Duncan made his first visit to the ER at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept. 26. Presby needs to be much more forthcoming about those missing details or face losing the public's trust. This newspaper — and, in turn, federal agencies — has crawled all over Parkland for errors and safety lapses that hospital made. Presbyterian deserves every bit as much scrutiny.Another lesson we should take away from Duncan's tragic death is that, while we certainly don't want to instill panic, we simply don't yet know enough about this disease to immediately discount what might at first blush seem like drastic safety precautions.That includes the ones suggested by Sen. Ted Cruz. For instance, I'm glad to see that five U.S. airports have announced today that they will begin taking the temperatures of travelers arriving from West Africa. Airport screenings alone won't stop this disease, but they are a reasonable additional safeguard. If nothing else, they might make someone think twice about trying to slip through the cracks.
