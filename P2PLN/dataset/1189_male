 Army intrigue and graft hits India's defencesConcern about worsening relations between India's army and government is graphically illustrated by a story that takes up the entire front page of The The Indian Express this morning about two key mechanised military units moving unexpectedly towards Delhi at night in mid-January. The government did not have the usual notifications about the alleged exercises, which have this morning been officially described as routine training.There has never been a fear in India of a military coup but, with a weak government and serious tensions both with (and within) the army, the news story raises issues that have caused serious concern today. Either some sections of the army were in a mood to cause alarm in Delhi, or the failure to notify the exercises amounted to a serious lapse of procedures.There have been strenuous denials this morning from the prime minister, defence minister, and many others that anything untoward or significant took place. The Indian Express is also being criticised for over-playing the story. Despite that, the furore caused by the report illustrates the current low point in army-government relations.India's defence capability problems are getting worse and are often in the news for all the wrong reasons - despite occasional good events such as the launching today of the country's first nuclear-propelled submarine. Most public sector defence equipment companies have been failing the country for years by not maximising the output of efficiently manufactured equipment. As a result, India's defence capability has been crippled in many areas by outdated weapons, and the government has generally failed to act.Now the government faces a bitter chief of army staff who has turned whistleblower on both India's lack of defence preparedness and a controversial army truck contract, amid complaints from frustrated private sector defence companies that are blocked from obtaining contracts by a self-serving defence establishment.Top Indian defence companies in the Confederation of Indian Industry yesterday appealed to the prime minister to set up a National Defence Manufacturing Commission within his office (PMO) that would do what the Ministry of Defence will not do and end the inefficient and often corrupt public sector domination of the industry. But they know this is unlikely to happen during the lifetime of the current government because of its lack of leadership both in the ministry and more widely.Surely only a comedy film producer would accept a script where newspapers splash across their front pages complaints from a country's army chief of staff about his battle tank fleet being "devoid of critical ammunition to defeat enemy tanks" and air defence being "97 per cent obsolete", just as the president of the country's most powerful potential enemy arrives in town.Yet that is just what happened last week when General V.K. Singh, the chief of army staff, hit the headlines while China's president Hu Jintao was in Delhi for a BRICS summit along with fellow leaders from Russia (supplier of much of the defunct equipment), Brazil and South Africa - as well as the world's top defence equipment companies attending Delhi's big biennial DefExpo show.A letter that Singh had sent to the prime minister on March 12 was leaked to the media on Match 28. It named the tank ammunition and air defence problems and also said that the infantry had "deficiencies of crew served weapons" and lacked "night fighting" capabilities. Elite special forces were "woefully short" of "essential weapons", and there were "large-scale voids" in critical surveillance and night fighting capabilities.Earlier in the week, Singh had dropped another bombshell, claiming he had been offered a $2.8m bribe by another army general to buy what he claimed were faulty Tatra army trucks (Czech made for an Indian-owned UK-based company).General Singh is a proud and frustrated officer because he has recently lost a long-running and widely publicised battle with the government over his age and thus over whether he would retire this year or next - he will now go at the end of May. Critics allege that he made the bribe and defence equipment statements to get revenge, and a gaggle of politicians and commentators immediately called for his dismissal.But that reaction was unfair and was quite possibly partly encouraged by rival generals and defence companies anxious to devalue his bribe allegations. The battle over his age turned partly on who would succeed him as army chief and this involved, some observers say, rival Hindu-Sikh and caste loyalties. A different general would have taken over if he had stayed another year and that might also have favoured some companies more than others, as well as giving Singh another year to try to tackle corruptionIronically, Singh and A.K.Antony, the defence minister, should be close allies because both are unusually free of corruption - something that cannot be said for a lot of other generals and politicians. But while Singh is a man of action and has tried to clean up some of the army's corruption (thus antagonising other generals), Antony is a weak politician scared of taking decisions that might sour his clean image.India has an annual defence budget of $40bn, and is the world's biggest importer of defence equipment according to a recent report, accounting for 10% of global arms imports between 2007 and 2011. China was the biggest importer but its inward trade had declined in recent years because it has dramatically modernised its defence manufacturing industry, something India has singularly failed to do. India's defence imports are officially put at 70%, but the actual figure is far higher, maybe around 85%, if imports made quietly by defence public sector corporations (DPSUs) are included.Antony is not a reformer. He has even blocked the designation of 12 big companies, including Tata, Larsen  Toubro, HCL and Mahindra, as defence "champions" capable of becoming internationally recognised defence systems integrators. He has apparently been persuaded by small and medium sized companies that they would be left out, whereas they would actually gain as suppliers to the 12. He has also bowed to defence establishment pressure and watered down offset plans that would force foreign suppliers to make up to 40% of their equipment in India. These moves have serious undermined reform initiatives started when Pranab Mukherjee, now finance minister, was in charge of defence till 2006.Sadly, the chances of this government making such policy leaps are slim, as has been seen in so many other areas over the past few years. But it needs urgently to address basic issues that are devaluing its once proud army.For a longer version of this article, with more details of corruption allegations on the UK-linked army truck contract, go to John Elliott's Riding the Elephant blog http://wp.me/pieST-1Ee
