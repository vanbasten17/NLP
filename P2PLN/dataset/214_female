How does a three-bedroom house on 600 sq m just seven kilometres from the city for the rip-roaring price of $450,000 sound? Or maybe something nearer to the centre of a smaller town for about $300,000?With prices surging in Australia's two most-populous cities, perhaps it's time struggling first home buyers and young families looked a little further afield - and extended their horizons when it comes to jobs, social networks and pre-conceptions about the rest of Australia.Undoubtedly there's a lot to love about Sydney and Melbourne. Sydney's fabulous beaches and Melbourne's gorgeous bars for a start.Sydney and Melbourne are both fantastic cities but for many, they are breathtakingly expensive, too.There  a world out there where the median house price isn't $690,064 (Sydney). More like $435,153 (Adelaide) or $440,454 (Brisbane).And just what those median prices buy you in terms of distance from the CBD, traffic congestion and a more relaxed lifestyle is vastly different, given the different sizes and densities of the cities.There's also a host of regional centres in nearly every state and territory where median house prices are sub $300,000 and units are even cheaper.Of course there are plenty of reasons to put off making a move out of your comfort zone - finding a job, leaving friends, settling in and wondering if there'll be anything to do.And when it comes to career, moving out of Australia's biggest cities may not be for everyone. There are just some jobs that require you to be in the thick of things.But for the vast majority of people who have skills and careers that make them employable in many locations, there are opportunities for those prepared to look.It just requires you to be brave and open to new challenges.The recent surge of technology means it has never been easier to feel connected to family and friends from afar, to research new areas, and for a growing number of people, to work remotely or establish a business that suits remote work.In NSW, the government will even pay you to move.From January, in a long overdue move, the $7000 regional relocation grant scheme will be opened up to renters in Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong who move to and buy in one of the state's regional areas more than 100 kilometres from where they have been living.City renters will need to provide at least two consecutive years of rental history to be eligible for the $7000 grant.The New Year will also herald the beginning of the $10,000 ''skilled regional relocation incentive'' for people who relocate to regional areas to fill local jobs for a minimum of two years, without the need to buy property.What remains to be seen now is whether people will actually make the move.
