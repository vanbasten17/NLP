When a diagnosis of cancer is made, doctors tend to concentrate purely on treating the physical condition. However, a three-part study by the universities of Edinburgh and Oxford shows that clinical depression in people with cancer is six times more common than in the rest of the population. This may not come as a great surprise - particularly in the cases of patients whose outcome is not likely to be good - but, shockingly, it seems that there is little or no support available from the NHS as part of the cancer treatment plan. Screening for depression does not happen.Led by Professor Michael Sharpe and Dr Jane Walker, part one of the study (published in The Lancet Psychiatry) followed more than 21,000 patients who visited cancer clinics in Scotland. The results showed that up to three in every four patients with major depression received no treatment at all. The rest were given medication.Part two (published in The Lancet) formed the result of a programme developed by the researchers - "Depression Care for People with Cancer". This clinical trial used medication plus specially trained nurses and psychiatrists, working with GPs and cancer specialists, to help patients "regain control of their lives". Less expensive than some medicines, the programme showed that 62 per cent of patients had a 50 per cent improvement in the level of depression.The third part (published in The Lancet Oncology) focused on those patients with a poorer outlook. These patients were treated with a version of the programme - which included home visits from nurses - and, after 8 months, the patients reported a better overall quality of life.Responding to this research, Jacqui Graves - head of Health and Social Care from Macmillan Cancer Support - said "Depression may be a temporary reaction to a patient's diagnosis and something that can be addressed through information and support but, in other cases, it can be more complex and a patient may need therapy and/or medication."It is estimated that three-quarters of cancer patients will suffer from a degree of depression - and, I suspect, that too many will try and cope alone, not identifying the feelings of sadness, anger and fear overwhelming them as anything other than the reaction to the diagnosis. While the NHS digests the findings of this latest research, help and support can be found from a charity - Maggie's Cancer Caring Centres. Maggie's psychologists work with individuals, couples and families to find the best ways of managing depression and stress - giving the patient the emotional strength to cope with the diagnosis, the treatment and the change in his or her life.In the USA and Canada, The Cancer Support Community - affiliated to Maggie's in the UK and other cancer charities globally - is a professionally-led, non-profit, organisation. Its network of cancer support "communities", found in many north American cities, offers access to mental health professionals - qualified in oncology - who play an important role throughout the entire cancer experience. This can be in-person, online or over the telephoneThe American College of Surgeons' Commission on Cancer has put new standards in place, to ensure patients are screened for psycho-social distress - and referred accordingly to interventions and resources.Surely this must be the route down which the NHS needs to go?Put together the "I am not the Cancer" exploration of the psycho-social impact of advanced breast cancer from Novartis Oncology's "Here and Now" campaign, (which illustrates just how important it is to treat the patient holistically), with the current research from Macmillan, (which shows that loneliness makes cancer patients three times more likely to struggle with their treatment plan - skipping appointments, not taking the medication, not picking up prescriptions and refusing treatment) - and it becomes abundantly clear that if un-diagnosed or un-treated depression is added, the patient will be more than 'struggling'.Loneliness and depression make a damaging mix for a cancer patient. It is imperative that both conditions should be identified if the cancer treatment plan is to do its best work for the patient.Not only would a programme like "Depression Care for People with Cancer" raise the quality of life for a cancer patient but it would fall into Nice's favourite category - "cost-effectiveness".
