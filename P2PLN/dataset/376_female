Leading up to 13 October - Breast Cancer Care's Secondary Breast Cancer Awareness Day - comes the publication of Breast Cancer Campaign's "Gap Analysis 2013", which has identified the ten "critical" gaps that exist in current breast cancer research.Co-authored by Professor Sue Eccles, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Professor Alastair Thompson, University of Dundee - and facilitated by Breast Cancer Campaign - The Gap Analysis 2013 "provides us with what we need to know and what we need to do to overcome - prevent, cure and outlive - breast cancer by 2050."Breast Cancer Campaign's first Gap Analysis - published in 2008 - highlighted the need to build up a supply of good quality breast tissue, which would be available to all breast cancer researchers in UK and Ireland. The Breast Cancer Tissue Bank was born and goes from strength to strength. Eventually it will become a resource for scientists anywhere in the world. Indeed, even I have had an inquiry, from a researcher in New York, as to whether or not she could access the Bank.This latest Gap Analysis expresses the urgent need for the ten identified gaps to be closed.These gaps are in the key areas of genetics, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and support and, in order for these gaps to be closed as quickly as possible, Breast Cancer Campaign makes the suggestion that "the scientific community, funding organisations, industry, policymakers and Government must now join forces. If this happens, the charity believes that breast cancer can be overcome by 2050." The charity's campaign to raise the Â£100 million needed - over the next ten years - is called "Help Us to Find the Cures".Among the eight key ambitions set out in the study are: Tackling secondary breast cancer: By 2020, 25 per cent fewer people will develop secondary breast cancer and by 2030 more than half of those who do develop secondary breast cancer will survive beyond five years. Living with and beyond breast cancer: By 2025 all those diagnosed with breast cancer, and the people close to them, will receive individually tailored information and support to meet their needs; to help them live with and manage the consequences of breast cancer and its treatment. Biobanking and enabling research: By 2023 a fully cohesive and collaborative global infrastructure to support breast cancer research will be in place, including the provision of tissue samples and bioinformatics, speeding up the pace of discovery and translation into patient benefit.Baroness Delyth Morgan, Chief Executive, Breast Cancer Campaign said: "If we don't act now, by 2030 more than 1.2 million women could be living with, or after, a breast cancer diagnosis and around 185,000 lives could have been lost to breast cancer. We want future mothers, daughters and wives to have their breast cancer prevented, cured, or for them to outlive the disease, and hope that together we can achieve this by 2050."The action plan for "Help Us To Find the Cures" is published through the support of Asda's "Tickled Pink" campaign - illustrating just what is meant by "joining forces".Looking to see which other charities are working for those whose breast cancer has spread or returned, I found - apart from Breakthrough and Cancer Research UK - that "Against Breast Cancer", is funding its research at the University of Westminster, "to identify markers that can detect the reappearance of breast cancer in women already treated for this illness" and prevent "secondary spread". The charity also began the National Diet and Lifestyle Study of breast cancer survivors - which was adopted by the UK National Clinical Research Network in 2005 and is the only research team in Europe to use the GlycoStation technology for the study of glycans - "a common feature of a broad variety of cancers, including breast cancer".Reading its website, I noticed that it refers to "our exceptional collection of breast tissue and patient samples". In the spirit of "joining forces", would this not be the moment to merge its collection with that of The Tissue Bank?
