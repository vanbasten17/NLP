I recently interviewed drum'n'bass star Friction. As well as being the face of Radio 1's flagship drum'n'bass show, he is currently at work on his new album, which features the huge forthcoming single, Long Gone Memory (featuring Arlissa on vocals).He recently hosted Original Penguin's rooftop 'Plugged In' summer party, which sees the clothing brand working with breaking acts and crossing genres with each event. So far this year they have organised parties with the likes of Benga, Jake Bugg, Devlin and Miles Kane.Following on from our interview, I've been granted an exclusive first airing of a live promo (filmed at the Plugged In summer party), which accompanies the song, so enjoy!For more tracks and interviews go to www.originalpenguinpluggedin.com
