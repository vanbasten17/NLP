If Australians are so determined to live in high-risk bushfire zones, should they be forced to adapt all houses - not just those being rebuilt after they've been destroyed - to make them more resistant to fire or flood?Last month, as the fire cleanup was in full swing, the NSW Blue Mountains state MP, Roza Sage, dismissed the idea of retrofitting existing homes as too costly, saying "with new homes it can add anywhere between $30,000 up to $100,000, depending on the flame zones".New homes and major renovations must meet strict regulations such as having sprinkler systems, water tanks, metal fly-screens and rooves and fascias that make them less susceptible to ember attack.But it's a timely question to pose: if you're going to live in a high-risk area, should you need to make sure your home, regardless of its age, is set up for it? If only because better-equipped properties should, in theory, be less-risky for fire fighters to defend, and potentially reduce the risks to other people's lives.There is plenty of knowledge of what can be done to buildings to make them bushfire-resistant. After Black Saturday in 2009, the Country Fire Authority in Victoria issued a  on how to retrofit properties.And in the south-east of Western Australia, one architect, Ian Weir,  In fact, he hopes it will one day to test his building principles.The cost of retrofitting existing homes would not be cheap, and would need to be a phased program - potentially implemented as properties are traded - for example, requiring all properties being sold to be retrofitted to a required standard prior to the sale or within a set time after the purchase - placing the onus on either the buyer or the seller.Cameron Frazer, general manager of Archicentre, the building inspection and design service of the Australian Institute of Architects, says the devastating fires of the last decade in the ACT, Victoria and NSW continue to reinforce the importance of fire-resistant homes.And Frazer says it's not just in the bush that the message is important - the growing urban sprawl surrounding Australia's capital cities is pushing more householders into riskier areas."The urban sprawl is placing tens of thousands of new homes on the fringe of major cities every year, often interfacing with fire-prone areas including forests and grasslands," says Frazer.While Frazer argues that you can't completely fireproof a home - unless you build a concrete box - he says that a well-designed and sited property equipped with fire prevention measures stands a significantly better chance of survival.
