Last week's interest rate cut hasn't proven to be quite the shot in   the arm many real estate agents thought it would be and as 2011 rounds   out, the industry is hoping home buyers will come back with renewed   vigour after the New Year.On the face of it, the fundamentals look good for a positive start in 2012.Affordability has risen thanks to the mix of falling home prices and   back-to-back interest rate cuts, which were eventually passed on  despite  the seeming unlikelihood of that happening as the days wore on  last  week. There's also the whiff of more rate falls either when the  Reserve  Bank gets back to business in February or in the months to  follow.On top of that, there has been a  - evidence that more people are planning to buy.And with Christmas looming we may see a last-minute buying rush as   sellers decide they want to offload their homes before the year ends and   buyers are equally keen not to drag out the home inspection duties any   longer.But caution remains. Outside of the booming mining industry, there is   still plenty of talk of pain, which doesn't engender much confidence  to  buy a house or upgrade for people in, or close to, those industries.The problems clouding over Europe have bitten into the Australian   psyche despite our economy being the envy of the world. There is the   fear of contagion from potential problems abroad and it has householders   trying to pay down their debt rather than going further into the red.Australians have moved to an entrenched savings mentality and are   tending to make do with what they have - as evidenced by the rising rate   of home renovations reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics  and  the poor auction clearance rates for most of this year.The double rate cuts don't seem to have helped yet - Sydney, for   example, had its worst clearance rate of the year last Saturday at a   revised 50.4 per cent. The same time last year it was 54.1 per cent. In   2009 it was 64.3 per cent.If we look back at 2008 and 2009 we can see that what underpinned the   sudden activity in the housing market then was the federal government   stimulus.Tempted by overly tasty offerings, first-home buyers jumped into the   market, and their enthusiasm flowed onto people upgrading and even some   investors. Yes, we'd had big interest rate cuts but it was really the   federal government money that lit the buying fire.Given the government is scrambling to get back into the black now, we   probably won't see such big incentives rolled out again in the near   future should we hit another rough patch. And nor should we -   affordability, having for many people reached a peak, is finally coming   down now that the market is being allowed to find more of its own  level.That's not good news for current homeowners trying to sell but if   they plan to buy again in a similar market, the positives lie on the   other side of the transaction.So will the housing market fire up like a New Year's Eve cracker once   we get back into the swing next year? While rate cuts could provide a   bit of a boost, people are wary of just why the cuts are coming -   concerns about the economy.So until the dark clouds disperse abroad and Australians feel like   the world has moved out of rocky territory, the property market is more   likely to light up like a New Year's Eve sparkler come 2012 rather than   the full shebang over the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
