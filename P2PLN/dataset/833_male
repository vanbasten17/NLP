TSB has today been branded the worst bank for customer service. Handing it the dubious honour were users of the MoneySavingExpert website. Some 9,000 of them voted, which gives the figures some validity, although its poor vote may well reflect the high number of disgruntled customers still feeling disaffected after being shunted off from Lloyds Banking Group last year.Topping the table is online bank First Direct - owned by HSBC - whose customers are more than twice as likely to rate their bank's service as "great" compared to those of TSB.Lloyds TSB was split into two banks six months ago and millions of customers were automatically transferred to TSB in one of British banking's biggest shake-ups. Account holders who were shifted to TSB are more disappointed by the service they've received than those that remained with Lloyds. TSB has been busy marketing itself as a community-focused enterprise with an emphasis on local banking, but it seems they have yet to persuade customers of its value.The website first did a similar survey in 2008, and since then Spanish-owned Santander has moved from rock bottom to 2nd place - but only for its Santander 123 account.Â  The full results are below...Since I published the blog TSB has been in touch with the following statement:Paul  Pester, TSB's CEO, said: "Any customer who feels unhappy with TSB is  one too many for me. However, given what we had to put our customers  through last year to create TSB and given the well-publicised failure in  Lloyds Banking Group's systems which affected our customers I'm not  surprised some customers are upset: I would be."The  fact is we are on a mission to deliver the best customer experience in  banking. And we've started. 70% of 23,587 customers we asked last month  about the service they have received from TSB scored us either nine out  of 10 or 10 out of 10. The team at TSB and I won't rest until 100% of  our customers score us 10 out of 10."
