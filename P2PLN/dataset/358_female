We are approaching the first anniversary of the death of the television journalist, Ellie Jeffery, who died of secondary breast cancer at the age of only 29. Ellie was diagnosed in May 2011 and secondary breast cancer was confirmed in May 2012 - a rare "flipping" had taken place and her hormone receptive cancer had become triple negative, which is notoriously difficult to treat.Ellie wrote of her diagnosis, treatment and the general problems of living with cancer in her blog Written Off, which is still available to read. She died just a few weeks before her carefully planned wedding to the television producer, Tom Thostrup.She titled her blog Written Off because that is exactly what her original doctor had done and, if Ellie had not achieved a second opinion, she would have continued to be treated for a cancer she did not have.As I said in my first post about Ellie, Written Off reflected Ellie's humour, honesty and hope, all of which shone through, as did her strength of character.Speaking to her during her last year, Ellie stressed to me that no one should be afraid to ask for a second opinion. In her blog she described the various members of the medical profession who neither impressed her nor gave her the confidence she needed. She finally found the doctor she referred to as "Professor Hope". The Professor is now revealed as Justin Stebbings, who works at the London Oncology Centre - and who has just been nominated for The Daily Mail and Lloyds' Pharmacy Health Heroes award.In memory of Ellie - and With Professor Stebbings as Patron - Ellie's fianc√©, Tom has joined forces with friends of his and Ellie's to launch The Eleanor Rose Foundation. Using Ellie's experiences of living with secondary breast cancer, the aim of the Foundation is to "connect individuals in active treatment for cancer - and those who care for them - with people who have a skill, service or product to offer".The website will be called "Ellie's Friends" and the Foundation is looking for skilled people from all over the country to sign up and offer their services either free of charge, or at a reduced rate. These services could be anything from a half-hour of yoga, a pampering appointment at a spa to a week in someone's holiday home. It is hoped, too, that entertainment companies and hotels will offer tickets or rooms.As the Foundation's website says "Cancer treatment is both a huge physical and mental challenge and the kindness and generosity of others during this time can make a huge difference". However, with the best will in the world, the cancer or its treatment does not always leave you with enough energy to travel any distance - so it is the ambition of The Foundation to ensure that "these benefits will be enjoyed within easy reach of home". Many people with cancer have to stop working and live on a restricted income, so a "treat" on your doorstep would be a huge boost to flagging spirits.It is hoped that the website will also provide all sorts of information about local support groups and charities; enable those living with cancer to communicate with each other; and work is being done on a range of body lotions and washes (lavender, lemon, jasmine and peppermint) and a coconut and orange lip balm - all organic and free of parabens, petrochemicals or artificial ingredients - to be called, appropriately, "Ellie's Smellies".If you would like to donate to the foundation - or if you have a skill or service you would like to offer or share with someone who is living with cancer, please click here and become one of Ellie's Friends.
