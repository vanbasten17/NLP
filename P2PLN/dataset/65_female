How many "get out of jail free" cards are there for Josh Brent, who faces a September trial on intoxication manslaughter charges in the death of a teammate?Back in May, Dallas County prosecutors took evidence to a judge that the Cowboys lineman, whose trouble with alcohol go back at least to a 2009 DUI, had either been drinking or "around alcohol"  and that someone had tampered with his monitoring device. The judge's response? Brent need not sit in jail until his September trial but he did need an additional alcohol monitoring device and must be home at 3 a.m. each day. (3 a.m. Really?)Last month, Brent was hauled back to jail again — this time for testing positive for marijuana. But he's out again, this time with a ban on driving and a requirement that he wear a drug detection patch at all times.It's bad enough, as colleague Mike Hashimoto wrote recently, that Brent remains on the Cowboys roster. But how many chances will the judiciary give Brent to obey the rules? Does he just keep getting do-overs until his trial rolls around?
