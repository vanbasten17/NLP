The home secretary, Theresa May, is to be questioned by a committee of MPs about her role in the public feud with the education secretary, Michael Gove, about allegations of extremism in Birmingham schools.Keith Vaz, chair of the home affairs committee, said there was a strong case for the committee also taking evidence from Fiona Cunningham, who resigned as May's special adviser on Saturday. A Downing Street inquiry had determined Cunningham should take the blame for a Home Office broadside against Gove intended to show he had ignored warnings about extremists in schools in 2010.At the same time Gove was forced to write letters of apology to Charles Farr, head of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism, and to David Cameron for his role in the row that infuriated the prime minister because it overshadowed last week's Queen's speech, made the government look dysfunctional and implied that his ministers are increasingly preoccupied with the identity of his successor as leader of the party.Vaz said: "I have written to the home secretary for a full explanation of what has happened. The committee will in due course question her about these matters. There is a strong case to hear from Ms Cunningham herself as to why she has resigned."In a joint letter to Cameron on Sunday, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, and Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, said Gove and May had both broken the section in the ministerial code saying that cabinet secrets should not be revealed and that, given that Gove had apologised, it was particularly important for Cameron to say whether May had also broken the code, and whether she would be apologising.The row started when Gove used a private lunch at the Times, where he used to work as a journalist, to criticise the Home Office for what he believes is its failure to take a robust stance against Muslim extremists. In response, Cunningham, who is in a relationship with Farr, briefed journalists that Gove was at fault. On Wednesday the Home Office also posted on its website a letter from May to Gove criticising him for not responding to warnings about extremism in schools in 2010.May has not commented in public on the row and it is not clear whether she authorised the anti-Gove briefing or the decision to release the letter. Government sources suggested on Sunday that the fact Cunningham had resigned, after a detailed inquiry into exactly who did what conducted by the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, should be seen as evidence she alone was to blame, but many at Westminster find it difficult to believe she would have acted without May's approval.Cunningham, a former Sky News journalist, had been working for May since she was made home secretary in 2010 and they have a close working relationship.Cunningham worked in the Conservative party press office before the general election covering home affairs and she has been credited with playing a large part in May's evolution from a mid-ranking member of the shadow cabinet whose appointment as home secretary was a surprise to someone who, in a recent survey of Conservative members, was the clear favourite as next party leader, 12 points ahead of Boris Johnson.Gove says he does not want to become the next Tory leader, but he strongly favours George Osborne, and is said to think May would be unsuitable. These considerations have intensified what is also a fundamental policy disagreement .May can be reserved with colleagues, who find it hard to get close to her, but she bonded with Cunningham. In Whitehall the power of special advisers is largely determined by how close they are to their boss and Cunningham, who is confident and assertive, was seen as one of the most effective operators in the Conservative special adviser circle.However, Craig Oliver, Cameron's director of communications, is said to have had reservations about Cunningham promoting May's interests above those of the government as a whole.
