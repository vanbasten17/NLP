Among the most interesting part of the essay is the idea that families from all income brackets, from rich to poor, are increasing the time and money they invest in their children's cognitive development from the earliest ages. Everyone is getting the message, it seems.Â  But neither the poor nor middle-class families are doing so "as quickly and as deeply as the rich."Most important in the piece are its solutions, so I've summarized the conclusions of the author, Stanford education and sociology professor Sean Reardon, here:Invest much more heavily as a society in our children's educational opportunities from the day they are born. That means investing in developing high-quality child care and preschool that is available to poor and middle-class children. It also means recruiting and training a cadre of skilled preschool teachers and child care providers. These are not new ideas, but we have to stop talking about how expensive and difficult they are to implement and just get on with it.Invest in parents so they can better invest in their children. This means finding ways of helping parents become better teachers themselves. This might include strategies to support working families so that they can read to their children more often. It also means expanding programs like the Nurse-Family Partnership that have proved to be effective at helping single parents educate their children; but we also need to pay for research to develop new resources for single parents.Ensure greater business and government support for maternity and paternity leave and day care so that the middle class and the poor can get some of the educational benefits that the early academic intervention of the rich provides their children.Fundamentally, it means rethinking our still-persistent notion that educational problems should be solved by schools alone.
