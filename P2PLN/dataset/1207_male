It's never wise to write off dynasties, but if ever a political family deserved to fade away, it is the Nehru Gandhi dynasty which two days ago appointed Mallikarjun Kharge, 71, a little known and relatively inexperienced and elderly member of parliament, to lead the Congress Party in the Lok Sabha because neither Sonia nor Rahul Gandhi are willing to take the post.Rahul, along with his far-from-well mother, led the Congress to a shattering and personally humiliating general election defeat last month when the party won only 44 Lok Sabha seats, 162 less than in the outgoing parliament. This was the Congress's worst-ever result. It was even below the minimum figure of 54 (10% of the total) needed under India's constitution to be recognised as the official opposition it reduced Congress to the level of regional parties - the AIADMK from Tamil Nadu won 37 seats.Since that defeat, there have been many criticisms of the family's leadership, especially of Rahul's autocratic style and that of his advisers. Both mother and son offered to resign as the party's president and vice-president, but that was inevitably rejected by the party's top working committee. In an attempt to stem a subsequent revolt, two critics who were too outspoken in their personal criticisms of Rahul were instantly suspended from party membership.Loyalists then called for either Sonia or Rahul to become the official opposition leader in the Lok Sabha. Since Sonia is probably not well enough for the task and has always preferred to be visible but mostly silent in parliament, Rahul should, it could be logically argued, have taken the post since he was the party's assumed (but undeclared) prime ministerial candidate in the election.But there are snags. For years, he has regularly vanished from public view, often on unexplained trips abroad, and has shown no sign of having the stamina to sit day by day on the parliamentary front bench, or the leadership qualities to be effective if he was there. Given his lack of experience in parliament (he has only made two or three speeches in ten years as an MP), he would have also probably found it hard to win the respect and support of the AIADMK and the other opposition parties that Congress needs as allies in opposing the new BJP government.How then, one might ask, if he could not or would not lead the opposition, could Rahul have become prime minister, if Congress had won - or would he and Sonia have appointed someone else in the same way that Sonia appointed Manmohan Singh in 2004? Perhaps he expected to be dynastically parachuted into the prime minister's office so that he could preside from there, and in parliament, with the born-to-rule attitude that this shy and retiring man often displays.Be that as it may, having decided that they would not lead in the Lok Sabha, it was surely the Gandhis' duty to nominate a parliamentary leader who would command respect and provide robust opposition to Narendra Modi, the new prime minister.There were at least two veteran experienced and able candidates available - Kamal Nath, 67, who has held many ministerial posts and is famed for his connections in India and abroad, and Veerappa Moily, 74, a former Karnataka state chief minister who held various senior posts in the last government. The ambitious Nath would have been opposed by many other Congress leaders, and is thought not to be trusted by Sonia, but it is unclear why Moily was not picked.The most adventurous choice would have been Jyotiraditya Scindia, 43, a bright committed politician from a former royal maharajah's family in Madhya Pradesh and the son of the late Madhavrao Scindia who was a leading Congress politician of Sonia's generation. Jyotiraditya has won four elections as an MP and was a minister in the last government, but he has a fatal flaw - the Gandhis would not dare pick him because he would have immediately been seen, and might have become, an alternative leader challenging Rahul's dynastic supremacy.Kharge was presumably chosen because he has no further political ambitions, having briefly been railways minister in the last government. He made no secret of his obedience to the leadership. "I will seek the guidance of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi on what can be done and how to go about it. They will tell me," he told journalists when asked how and what he intended to do.This illustrates how political dynasties, and especially the Gandhis, fail their parties and the country by preferring to promote safe loyalists and not the best available people. It is difficult to see how Kharge, whose political career has mostly been spent in his home state of Karnataka, will gain respect in parliament, just as loyalists appointed to important ministries such as defence and home affairs in the last government failed to perform.Logically, Rahul's political career (if one can call it that) should now be over because he has led his party into defeats not only in this general election but two earlier state assembly polls. He has also refused to acknowledger whether he is a prime ministerial candidate and his attempts to reform the party have failed.But this is dynastic politics that do not follow such logic and the Gandhi family is essential for the survival of the Congress Party, which could break up in to rival factions without the Gandhi glue.With such loyalty, Rahul is probably safe, for now at least, with Sonia and Priyanka protecting him. But unless the family finds a way to reassert itself, this could be the beginning of the decline of the dynasty - and the beneficiary of all this of course is Narendra Modi who faces a rudderless and divided opposition as he starts the ten years that he wants to govern India. His supporters will welcome that, but others will say the family has again let the country down in order to protect its dynastic survival.For a longer version of this post and more photos, go to John Elliott's Riding the Elephant blog ‪http://wp.me/pieST-27l
