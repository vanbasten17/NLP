I wrote today's Presbyterian Hospital-Ebola editorial on behalf of the board. It's an editorial that focuses largely on why the hospital MUST be more forthcoming about everything that has transpired since Thomas Eric Duncan first arrived at its ER Sept. 26. In effect, Presbyterian has the chance to redeem itself to some degree after the mistakes it has made.One of the most important points we wanted to make is that it's not a matter of IF more cases emerge, but WHEN they do. Sure enough, before I had finished my first cup of coffee this morning, Nicole and I were working to update the editorial, as another case of Ebola has been confirmed overnight.Amid our natural tendencies to feel anxiety and panic, we have to keep things in perspective. Or, in the words of my pastor, spiritual and emotional calm. That's tough to do during this terrible window of time when it appears more Presby workers may become ill due to procedures around Duncan's care.The blame game is just so useless right now, whether aimed at the hospital or the victims.I'm most struck this morning by how we choose to react to our fear, as Dallas faces something so foreign to it. Some, as represented by colleague Rudy Bush's eloquent post yesterday, react with open hearts and spirits. Others, as represented by the hideous comments to the op/ed on our home page by Duncan's nephew, succumb to fear-mongering and hatred.My prayer this morning is that folks try to have some compassion.  And to remember, as far away and abstract as West Africa may seem, those countries are looking at upwards of 10,000 Ebola cases a week. That's ground zero, not Dallas.I'd challenge us all to work hard to keep our better selves front-and-center so we show the world the kind of people we really are here in Dallas — even in our most anxious moments.
