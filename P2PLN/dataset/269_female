Is it time we stopped and lingered a little, and got to know those around us? Urban design consultant David Engwicht thinks so."In years gone by our sense of home actually extended out our front door, out into the street, down to the corner store, into the centre of town. That sense of home has been gradually shrinking," says Engwicht who, as a "placemaker", has a Brisbane business called Creative Communities and is regularly consulted about how to breathe life into civic spaces.Engwicht says Australian cities are organised around planned exchanges. "Everybody is rushing here, there and everywhere to go to a planned meeting of some kind," he says."But the vitality of any public space and particularly residential neighbourhoods is entirely dependent on the health of the spontaneous exchange realm."Examples of that are when elderly people used to sit out in the public domain, usually at the crossroads at an intersection. Anybody walking past could sit down and have a chat to them and hear some stories, and if they were having some life problems, kind of ask for some advice and get some wisdom from the elderly folks."That was a spontaneous form of exchange where the elderly people distilled their life's journey into some wisdom and got to share it with people passing by."If we don't have those seats there, then we remove the opportunity for that spontaneous exchange and we replace it with a planned exchange - which is bussing them to the senior citizens hall where they can play bingo or knit doilies."The implications of living life fast - and often isolated - extend to social justice, democracy and creativity, says Engwicht."Our culture has what I call a mobility-centric view of the world, which kind of came out of the Industrial Revolution where we started seeing everything in machine terms. And so anything standing still was an idle machine that was unproductive."If we see people sitting around lingering, we kind of think they're being unproductive and we want to move them on and we want to ban them."But a tree has got to stand still to draw nourishment from the soil and there's a balance to all of this that sometimes you become more productive when you actually stop."Engwicht's major driver to encourage people to psychologically reclaim their footpath and their street."What has happened over time over the last 20 to 30 years is that as a society we have psychologically surrendered those spaces to car traffic," he says."That psychological retreat includes people not gardening in their front gardens any more, or [at least] less, putting up high fences, not parking their cars in the street, and moving their socialising from the front of the house to the back verandah."Instead, people should see the footpath and the streetscape as extensions of their home territory. Doing so could involve taking down your high front fence, planting edible plants or pretty flowers at picking height on the street, or placing a seat for passers-by to linger."It might be taking a book out, sitting on the footpath and reading the book in the sun," says Engwicht."There are 1001 ways. I had a gentleman in Seattle who decided to have dinner on his front lawn twice a week. He told me that he built more community in his street in two months' of having dinner on his front lawn than in 20 years as a community activist."
