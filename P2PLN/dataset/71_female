Weekends allow me the time to read the best of newspapers, magazines and (my current passion) short story genius without feeling the onerous pressure of deadlines that dog me Monday through Friday (i.e., no matter what I am concentrating on, I can't erase the thoughts of what needs to be read next).Among the "best" of my weekend reading was a front-page narrative from the Washington Post that was equal parts hypnotic and repulsive in the raw grief it portrayed. I started reading it twice over the course of the weekend, both times deciding it was just too painful to continue. But early this morning, upon seeing yet another colleague's words about it, I plunged into the Barden family's story again.  This time I made it all the way through.Some will say that this is a manipulative effort on behalf of gun safety/control. But regardless of your views on gun laws, I hope you'll take the time to read this essay. The death of a child is always incomprehensible, but death that came as it did to Daniel Barden at Sandy Hook .... there really are just no words to describe what his parents are going through. But somehow Post writer Eli Saslow did.I recommend this piece to everyone. It will help you remember those you know who have experienced similar loss — and how you might continue to support them for decades, not just days, after their tragedies.
