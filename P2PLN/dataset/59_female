For those of you who missed Tuesday night's event, DMN video producer Brian Elledge has put together a terrific 30-minute highlights reel. Can't wait to see where we go next with this effort. Thanks again to Mayor Mike Rawlings, Bishop T.D. Jakes, Liz Cedillo-Pereira and Paul Quinn President Michael Sorrell â€” and to everyone who was on hand in the City Performance Hall or watching the live stream. Here's our editorial and Rudy Bush's column off the event.Stay tuned for where we take the "Come Together" effort.
