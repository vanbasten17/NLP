He doesn't need much of an introduction but Lee 'Scratch' Perry is a pioneer of the reggae world and one of the most influential artist/producers to ever have stepped into a recording studio. Building an experimental studio in his back yard, in Jamaica, "Scratch" was the producer on early recordings for such seminal musicians as Bob Marley  the Wailers, Junior Byles, The Heptones, and Max Romeo. His estoeric, often bewildering approach to music resulted in some of the most dynamic, experimental and downright special music to have ever come out of Jamaica. Now in his seventies, Perry continues to contribute to the forefront of new music, with his recent work including a collaboration with electronic explorers, The Orb.Lee 'Scratch' Perry recently performed at Fred Perry's Sub-Sonic Live series in a specially curated event by legendary British reggae ambassador David Rodigan MBE. This live track 'How Do You Do' demonstrates why Lee continues to command respect and devotion from crowds across the globe.Fred Perry Subculture - Sub-Sonic Live - Lee "Scratch" Perry - 'How do you do?' from Fred Perry on Vimeo.For further live tracks from Sub-Sonic Live Series go to www.fredperrysubculture.comFollow Marcus Barnes' www.hoxton.fm radio show via soundcloud.com/marcus_barnes
