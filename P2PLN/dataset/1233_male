There's been a nice irony in New Delhi tonight where top politicians led by prime minister Manmohan Singh, and Sonia Gandhi, the governing coalition's leader, went to the old city's Ramlila grounds to celebrate today's Dussehra Festival.The festival marks the triumph of good over evil as King Rama defeats King Ravana, who had abducted Rama's wife Sita to what is now Sri Lanka.Displays of fireworks all over the country have this evening ended with ceremonial burnings of Ravana effigies, often in a trio with his son Meghnad and brother Kumbhakaran.The Ramlila location in Delhi was accidentally symbolic because it was here a month or so ago that Ana Hazare, the Mahatma Gandhi look-alike who has led a massive campaign against corruption, defeated the government. First the politicians pleaded with him not to go on an extended hunger fast, then they jailed him, then pleaded with him to leave jail, then agreed to pick up some of his anti-corruption demands.In this context Hazare, even though he has many critics, is on the side of "good" and the government symbolised "evil". Meanwhile Hazare was at celebrations in his village where he said, "We all need to burn the Ravana of corruption inside us".Could Rama have done any better!For a longer version of this post, with more pictures and details of how Dussehra has brought record hits to John Elliott's Riding the Elephant blog, go to http://wp.me/pieST-1rI
