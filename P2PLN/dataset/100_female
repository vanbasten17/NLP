I smell a controversy brewing over the proposed renaming of a portion of North Central Expressway — from Interstate 30  to Park Lane — for George W. Bush. Or maybe I'm just hoping for some pushback to state Rep. Dan Branch's recent proposal. (Read about it here on Unfair Park and here on the DMN Transportation blog.)Housing the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas is one thing. Regardless of one's politics (and mine would never be confused with the Bush family's), locating Bush's presidential museum/institute here isn't a bad deal for our city, in terms of tourist-researcher dollars and historic value. And I'm not surprised that SMU would rename one of its campus streets "Bush Avenue," given that the former president's complex is on its campus.But renaming Central? Maybe I'm just sentimental — since the first time my parents gave me permission to drive beyond the McLennan County line, "North Central" has been part of my social lexicon. I'm not a big fan of changing street names — especially if the "honoree" has plenty of other monuments to his or her stature.More important than my sentimental views is the confusion factor. In regard to the White House and subsequent naming rights, George W.'s dad "got here first" and thus we already have one major thoroughfare called "the Bush." In terms of simple logistics, a second one is just one too many!Whether you call it North Central, Central Expressway or just plain Central, let's leave the name alone. By the time we get past all the ribbon-cutting, speech-making and massive publicity around the opening of the Bush Center, I promise that this city will have given George W. his due. Don't give him Central too.
