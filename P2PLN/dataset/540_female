I have received a large number of emails and comments asking for the symptoms of male breast cancer - and suggestions that we should not call it "male" breast cancer. The term breast cancer should apply to both sexes. Fine by me!For the symptoms - if you look at my previous blog post headlined "My friend has breast cancer. And, naturally, he's worried" you will find the answer. Basically, the symptoms for men are the same as for women. If you are concerned about a lump ( large or small), a rash, a discharge (with or without blood) from or a change in direction of the nipple, or a thickening, puckering or dimpling of the skin go and seek medical advice immediately.If your GP does not feel it necessary to refer you to a consultant, be sure to insist. It is far better to be checked out than leave it too long.
