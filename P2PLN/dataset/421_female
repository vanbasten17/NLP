For the last few weeks I have been receiving emails from friends in the USA excited about the development of a drug called TDM-1 - a drug which has been proved to delay the worsening of breast cancer.TDM-1, developed by Genentech (within the Roche group), is only for women with the type of breast cancer called HER2 Positive. One in five breast tumours has high levels of the protein HER2 and the trial of TDM-1 was for 991 women whose HER2 Positive breast cancer had metastasised and for whom Herceptin, combined with a chemotherapy drug, had stopped working.Herceptin, too, was developed by Genentech and is also known as Trastuzumab - hence the T in TDM-1 - and it is this drug which is attached to the toxin DM1 with its even more powerful toxicity than current chemotherapy drugs.Released into the system, these "armed antibodies float through the bloodstream like floating sea mines" said Professor K. Dane Wittrup of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "bumping against various cells but only sticking to the cancer cells. When they end up in the particular harbour, they blow up".Apart from the obvious benefit of providing a halt before the disease worsens - the trial suggests 9.6 months compared with 6.4 months for those women on the trial who were being given the usual chemotherapy drugs - the toxicity is directly released only into the cells of a tumour and has no adverse effects on healthy cells. This has the significant advantage of greatly reduced side effects.Drug treatments of this type - antibody-drug conjugates - are just beginning to find success and, in the USA, it is hoped that TDM-1 will be available next year. Here in the UK the wait will be longer. TDM-1 has yet to receive a licence. Once Roche has achieved that first step, the process continues to Nice, who - depending on the cost of the drug - will pass it for use by the NHS or not.I can see that TDM-1 might find itself with the same problems as did Abiraterone for advanced Prostate Cancer - but I hope I am wrong and that Roche offers the drug at a price which Nice can accept. Maggie Alexander, Director of Policy at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said "Breakthrough will be providing information from the patients' point of view as part of any future review".At present, in the UK, chemotherapy is the only option for women whose HER2 Positive breast cancer has stopped responding to Herceptin but TDM-1 would give them a higher quality of life for a longer time without ghastly side effects - such as hair loss, black nails, peripheral neuropathy and/or constant fatigue.Although men, too, can develop breast cancer, TDM-1 has yet to be trialled on male patients - I assume because there are far fewer cases, which would make a trial difficult to set up.With Macmillan Cancer Support's new research revealing that one in five breast cancer patients will have a recurrence, we have to hope that these new types of treatments - one of which, Adcetris, has been approved already for use in the USA to treat two types of lumphoma - must be the way forward for all cancers.As in the trialling of CVac for ovarian cancer (see my blogs on the hope for new treatments for ovarian cancer sufferers  and how long we might have to wait for it in the UK), where the patient's own T cells are chemically primed to attack the ovarian cancer cells - immunotherapy of all sorts looks to a time when cancer treatment will kill the cancer but not hurt the patient.I'm doing the Pink Ribbon Walk to raise money for Breast Cancer Care on Saturday- you can donate using my Just Giving page.
