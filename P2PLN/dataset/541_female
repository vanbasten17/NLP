"Biomarker" is the new buzzword among researchers working on ways to detect breast cancer - and, indeed, other cancers - long before the patient suspects there is a problem. A protein called epidermal growth factor receptor is present on the surface of all cells. It is known that too much of it causes cancerous tissue to multiply; hence the tumour develops.A research project in the USA recruited 100,000 volunteers.  Blood was taken and analysed and, in those who developed breast cancer, researchers found that it was possible to detect minute malignant cells 17 months before the onset of the disease - the biomarker. It may well be possible to make the detection even earlier than 17 months.Obviously, this is just the beginning of  the research process, but it is an exciting possibility that, at some point in the future, women may not have to undergo mammograms. As tests go, they are uncomfortable at best and very painful at worst. For young women, whose breast tissue is thicker, the mammogram finds it difficult to detect small tumours and the reading is reliant on the skill of the technician.My breast cancer was found by the consultant not by the mammogram result, which was read as entirely normal. I was lucky to have the opportunity to be seen by an experienced consultant - too many women are told the mammogram is clear and never have the chance of an appointment with a consultant in time to prevent more radical treatment.Until biomarkers are the norm, all women (and men) who undergo routine mammograms should be seen also by a breast surgeon or - as I wrote last week - a trained nurse practitioner. Let us not rely on the mammogram alone.I would be interested to hear your views.  Email me - in total confidence - at judith.potts@telegraph.co.uk
