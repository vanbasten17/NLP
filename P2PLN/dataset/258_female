This week marks the beginning of the increased first home buyer grant in NSW.Gone is the $7000 incentive to buy an established property, and in its place is a reasonably lucrative $15,000 bonus for first home buyers purchasing or building new properties up to a total value of $650,000.On top of this, first home buyers in NSW also qualify for full stamp duty exemption on new properties valued up to $550,000, and there are partial exemptions for new properties valued between $550,000 and $650,000.All up, first home buyers in that state could receive benefits worth $35,240.It certainly is an attractive deal. But it should come with a warning to first home buyers; Don't just follow the money. Go in with your eyes wide open.We saw what happened just a few years ago when the federal government stimulated the economy by offering large grants to first timers. It fired the market up, pushing prices up rapidly as first home buyers rushed in and upgraders with pockets full of cash then competed for the more expensive properties.House prices jumped 24.3 per cent in Melbourne during the 12 months to June 2010, and 21.4 per cent in Sydney.This time around, at least, there won't be that flow-on effect to upgraders as the grants only apply to new property.However, there is still the incentive for first timers to dive into new property to cash in on the grants without researching the market fully, including looking at established homes. Older properties may not attract the grant and stamp duty concessions, but could represent better value given In the Sydney region, the bulk of first home buyers are likely to head to inner and middle ring apartments - mostly off the plan - or house and land packages on the outskirts, many of which are in the city's south-west.Off the plan has some advantages - you get a brand new property and some of the better developments have a good range of facilities such as childcare centres, cafes and restaurants.If you buy early you may also be able to secure a good north-facing orientation.The downsides are you can't see what you are getting until it is completed, and new isn't always better as there hasn't been time for problems to emerge and be fixed.Also, the pictures in the brochure may not much represent the finished product as changes are made during the building process, and the fixtures and fittings shown are not always what you end up with.There's also the problem of not being able to see the quality of the build, or ascertain just how big the spaces are.Some the  emerging in recent weeks have highlighted the  in some apartments.It is vital that buyer do their due diligence. This can mean looking at other apartments the developer and builder have been involved with, and speaking to owners who live in blocks already completed. Knock on doors if you have to.Buying your first property is a big decision that should be weighed up really well before you sign on the dotted line.It's relatively easy to sign a contract and buy in - but if you find yourself in a building plagued with defects, or a small, dark apartment that wasn't as big as you imagined or doesn't get much natural light, it can be quite another matter selling it.For more tips on how to do your home-buying homework, see this
