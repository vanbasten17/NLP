It's amazing what I have learned since becoming a Zite addict. But more amazing is what writers are doing to feed the 24-7 Internet beast. Consider this: DC.streetsblog.org, which "covers the movement to transform our cities by reducing dependence on private automobiles and improving conditions for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders," currently is running its own version of March Madness. Only its "madness" is parking and car congestion. Yesterday's bracket featured a faceoff between Dallas and Los Angeles for worst "parking crater." (Spoiler alert: Dallas moved on and will face the "winner" of the Denver-Atlanta showdown.)Sideswiped in yesterday's competition was the Perot Museum, which happens to be smack dab in the middle of the "parking crater" that DC.streetsblog highlighted. Apparently, James Howard Kunstler, social critic and suburbia historian, annoints an "eyesore of the month" and the Perot "won" the designation last month — partly based on the amount of concrete (and parking) that surrounds it. The images on Kunstler's blog about the Perot do look like miles and miles of nothing but cement — that El Fenix parking lot never looks that big when I'm trying to find a spot.
