Ahead of the huge changes to the welfare system that take effect in April, the Guardian is hosting a series of weekly Twitter chats looking at how the reforms will touch people's lives.In previous weeks, Guardian readers on Twitter told us what the so-called "spare room tax" would mean for them and their families, and how the switch from disability living allowance to personal independent payments would affect their day-to-day lives.On Wednesday 6 February from 2pm GMT, we'll be talking about changes to council tax benefits.Ministers have cut the support for means-tested council tax benefit by £500m, and told local authorities to decide where the axe should fall. The 325 councils affected have come up with differing ways to cope with the cut.Some, such as Tower Hamlets in east London, have decided to absorb the cuts and not to charge its low-income households. But in Brent, on the other hand, poorer residents will face an annual bill of £240 a year.Brentwood council says that families living in bigger houses - those in Bands F to H - will now have to pay the full council tax of almost £3,000 a year irrespective of income.You can see the New Policy Institute's analysis of what councils have decided to do here, and read the Guardian report here.Here is the Department for Communities and Local Government consultation on the changes.Tell us: Will the changes to council tax benefit affect you? Do you feel the changes are fair? What difference will it make to you and your family, or those you work with?Join us on Twitter between 2pm and 3pm GMT on Wednesday 6 February to share your views and ask questions.
