A long-awaited pick-up in the home building sector might finally be happening - albeit in a small way and confined to specific regions, mostly Perth, regional Western Australia and parts of NSW.However, it could be quite a while before the average person struggles to find a plumber or a builder, such was the case prior to the GFC."It's fairly narrow recovery at this point," says HIA chief Economist Harley Dale.Nevertheless, the news will be welcomed by those looking for evidence that the much-needed increase in housing supply has begun.Figures out today show that the availability of skilled trades hit its highest point in the three months to the end of June but fell moderately during the September 2013 quarter, indicating there has been more demand for workers in the construction industry.Dale says the availability of residential skilled labour was in surplus for ten consecutive quarters, but now appears to have peaked.Many builders won't be surprised by the HIA figures. Take volume builder GJ Gardner in NSW, which has 20 franchises across the state. In the last six months, the business has seen a 57 per cent increase in sales.Customers are wanting to spend more money too - with many pushing their budgets up by about 30 per cent, seeking to, mostly, build four-bedroom homes with two bathrooms, a media room, a pantry and a double garage.While the company attributes some of the growth to a recent restructure, spokesman Ben Everingham says low interest rates and increasing confidence are playing their part.Likewise, Allam Property Group, which sells house and land packages on the fringes of Sydney, is experiencing its highest level of enquiry in a decade."That increase in demand has been growing over the last 12 - 18 months," says Paul Sant, Allam's group general manager.The company sells about 200 spec homes a year but as it takes two or three years to develop each property from its raw land state, the business isn't able to nimbly respond to spikes in demand."We're turning people away at this point in time," says Sant.Not all builders are seeing a bright spot though.In Melbourne, David Whitford, the general manager building and construction at Simonds Homes, says demand has been "pretty static"."Not a whole lot has changed," he says.Whitford is yet to witness any real signs the predicted growth in home construction rates has begun.But Dr Dale says there should be further improvements in the construction industry in the coming quarters, particularly after the New Year.The HIA Trade Availability Index declined to +0.18 in the September 2013 quarter from a record high +0.24 in the June quarter.The tightening of trades availability has not flowed through to prices though -Â  HIA's Trade Prices Index increased by 1.7 per cent over the year to the September 2013 quarter, lower than the current inflation rate.
