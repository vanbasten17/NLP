Never did I think I would find myself sitting on a laboratory stool looking at a human brain - but, earlier this week, that is exactly what happened.At the kind invitation of Imperial College and Alzheimer's Research UK, I joined a group of people (most of whom in my group were young scientific researchers) and visited Imperial's Division of Brain Sciences. Here, work is being done to better understand, diagnose and treat Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's.Ahead of World Alzheimer's Day - 21st September - I wanted to find out a little about exactly where Alzheimer's fits into the world of dementia and how it differs from Vascular Dementia, which my late mother developed. Talking to the scientists, who kindly gave up their time for us, I found my explanation. The word "dementia" actually applies to symptoms - like memory loss, mood changes and confusion - and Alzheimer's is but one disease which causes dementia.There are other diseases - the best known being Vascular, Frontotemporal, Korsikoff's and Lewy bodies - but  "dementia" is the umbrella word, used by doctors before a definite diagnosis is confirmed or, as in my mother-in-law's case, where a GP cannot be bothered to make a proper diagnosis, simply waving his hand and saying "Well, it's dementia. It doesn't matter which kind."Knowing this is the attitude of some doctors, I was very interested to speak to Professor Paul Matthews - head of the division - who told me that patients and their families are encouraged to play a big part in decisions about the paths of research. I had heard a similar refrain from The James Lind Alliance - of which I am an affiliate - whose mission is to "bring patients, carers and clinicians together to identify and prioritise for research the treatment uncertainties which they agree are the most important".Professor Matthews spoke of his gratitude to the various charities who support the work of the division and from whom 40 per cent of the cost comes - once again, I find myself writing the same words: "Where would we be without the charities?" - and that the Wellcome Foundation will be funding new programmes of research, which will be announced in the next few months.The Professor's huge enthusiasm for his work was echoed by Dr Magdalena Sastre, Dr Amy Birch, Dr Loukia Katsouri and Dr Jane Saffell - who make up the team working on the neurobiology of Alzheimer's disease. I am afraid to say that much of their - I am sure fascinating - presentations went right over my unscientific head, but when we reached Dr  Katsouri's laboratory, she showed us magnified and highly coloured pictures of vascular dementia. This was an emotional moment for me. As she explained how the veins become clogged and interrupt the blood supply to the brain,  I saw on her computer exactly what happened to my mother.As we moved on from Dr Katsouri, we were led into the laboratory of Professor Steve Gentleman, who heads up the MS and Parkinson's Tissue Bank. Professor Gentleman - by nature as of name - ensured we were all sitting down before whisking away the cloth on the bench in front of him and uncovering a human brain. The Professor explained what he looks for on the surface of the brain to detect disease, and how the brain is then sliced, samples taken and stored in a freezer.Professor Gentleman and his team are on constant stand-by to receive donated brains but, amazingly, "fresh" brains are not always available because mortuaries are not staffed at weekends. Obviously, fresh material is the best on which to work. Apart from the problems unstaffed mortuaries cause to all researchers, what happens to the bodies of patients who die at a weekend?Asking patients with MS or Parkinson's to donate their brains after death is not an easy job and I wonder whether or not specially trained nurses - as at The Breast Cancer Tissue Bank - could be trained to ask that difficult question of the patient or the family? For dementia patients, it would have to be left to the family to make the decision.With an ageing population, the numbers of us who will develop dementia are growing, but there is still a terrible stigma attached to the disease - that of mental illness - and World Alzheimer's Day this year has, as its theme, not only the need to raise awareness of the symptoms, possible treatment and research, but also to challenge the stigma and begin to incorporate people with dementia into society.To this end, the Prime Minister recently opened the KIND cafe (Keeping Individuality through Nurturing Dementia) at a Barchester-run Care Home in Oxfordshire. Intended to promote the retention of life skills, it will be a meeting place for individuals and groups to seek friendship and advice and has been designed by Barchester's specialist design team, who introduced the concept of Memory Lanes in all Barchester's dementia homes.I left Imperial's Centre for Neuroscience and headed home, wondering how long it would be before Professor Gentleman's bleeper announced another brain was on its way. The day had been fascinating and my respect and regard for research scientists - and their dedication to finding the causes of Alzheimer's and then to developing a drug to halt the disease - knows no bounds.For information about all diseases leading to dementia - or to donate to the charity - please visit the website of Alzheimer's Research UK or call them on 01223 843899.
