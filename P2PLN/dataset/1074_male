I've been sunk a bit deep in Elena Ferrante over the summer, reading the third volume in her 'Neapolitan novels' for review in this newspaper, and then taking part in a discussion with other critics at Foxed Books last week to mark the book's publication - in preparation for which I read the two of her six published novels that I hadn't yet broached.I was thinking about the covers of this novel sequence (My Brilliant Friend, The Story of a New Name and Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay, with a fourth and final volume still to come) because I remember discussing them with another writer who said they didn't much like the designs - they were too cosy, too pretty, too safe for the stories they hold.Briefly, the books tell the story of two women, friends from an early age in their working class Naples neighbourhood, one of whom, the narrator, Elena, 'escapes' to become a writer and academic, while the other, Lila, despite being no less intelligent - and decidedly more sparky and determined - decides to stay and make her mark at home, marrying young and trying to break into business.It's true that these covers do seem hugely romantic, with their idealised images of marriage, companionship and motherhood - especially when compared to the covers of Ferrante's three previous, standalone novels, which, to give you an idea of their content, have been collected in a single Italian volume under the title Cronache del Mal d'Amore - Chronicles of Love-Sickness.These covers give an absolutely accurate sense of the disturbing narratives they contain - identity doubted, adult despair, and the strangeness of childhood (although the bare-bummed doll of The Lost Daughter is rather misleading). And it's true also that there is plenty of darkness in the Neapolitan novels. The marriages they feature are far from happy - wrecked by violence, oppression, mistrust Â and infidelity - and the parenthoods hardly less so. The books are the best kind of family saga, at once grippingly intimate, and giving a startling view of the changes in society over the decades after the Second World War: bad news, beautitfully told.So, contra my writer friend, I'd say it's possible to read the covers as sharply ironic: the images they present are ones that we, and the characters, hold dear, as true depictions of what they want from life, but which they find repeatedly ripped from them, or otherwise impossible to attain or retain. Also, by facing the people away from the reader, there's the suggestion that their expressions might not quite fit what we'd expect. The new groom staring off into space: who knows what he's thinking? Who knows the expression on the face of the woman with the white jumper, or the mother on the beach? How sure can you be that any of them are as happy as we'd perhaps like to think they are?That said - and as I mentioned with regards to a Joshua Ferris cover last week - an ironically cheery, fun or appealing cover is like having your cake and eating it: you draw people in with nice imagery, then after they've gone through the ringer of the tragic narrative, see that image as a bitter commentary on it.
