Soaring rents in Perth are forcing more people to pool together their funds and share properties, a specialist property manager has revealed."Some people spend 70 per cent of their income on rent," says Ellen Shaw, director of Ellen Shaw Realty. "In order to make ends meet, a lot of people decide to share."Asking rents for houses in Perth grew 15.4 per cent in the 12 months to the end of September, second only to a 27.3 per cent increase in Darwin, according to figures from Australian Property Monitors.Perth's advertised unit rentals also shot up 11.4 per cent in the year to the end of September.Shaw says demand is particularly strong for properties priced from $400 to $600 and there is usually a changeover period of just a day for rentals in this range.Once they are advertised, the properties are usually snapped up within a week.Early this week Shaw was showing a one-bedroom, one-bathroom property and had eight groups signed up to look through during an hour-long showing."That's how busy it is," she says.In some good news for renters with deeper pockets, Shaw says demand has cooled in the prestige market as many of the executives and middle managers arriving to work on the Gorgon gas project had found accommodation.Across the nation, there was also a slight easing in rental demand in the lead-up to Christmas. Figures released by SQM Research reveal rental vacancy rates rose during the month of December, increasing by 0.4 per cent nationally.However, the effect was probably seasonal, reflecting the tendency for people to move over summer and for university students to vacate for the Christmas break.SQM Research says the level of residential vacancies reached 63,089 in December on the back of increases in November. SQM calculates vacancies from online rental listings that have been advertised for three weeks or more, as a percentage of the total number of established rental properties.Melbourne had the highest vacancy rate (3.6 per cent) of the capital cities, with a total of 15,484 vacancies.Perth recorded the tightest vacancy rate of state and territory capitals. Just 0.9 per cent, or 1710  properties - were vacant.In Sydney, the vacancy rate was 2.1 per cent, up from 2 per cent a year ago.Rental agent Ross Mournehis, a senior property manager with Harris Tripp in Sydney's inner west, says demand for rentals has picked up in January after a slow December."There's definitely a lot of action happening, there is a lot of stock and a lot of movement," he says.  "There is a little bit more [stock] hanging over coming into January, so there is a lot more for people to choose from."While renters don't have so much choice to negotiate on asking prices in the Sydney's inner west, Mournehis says they can afford to be a little bit picky."Neater properties are definitely renting much better than properties that are in need of a bit of TLC," he says.In Perth, Ellen Shaw says the renters that get a look-in on securing a property are those who are well-organised with their applications and well-presented."After your viewing ... submit your application, don't wait for three days before you submit it," says Shaw. "Fill in as much detail and be as honest as you can."Present yourself as if you will be a responsible tenant that will take good care of the property. If you come in with frayed pants and cap back to front and tatts from here to kingdom come, you may go further down on the list."
