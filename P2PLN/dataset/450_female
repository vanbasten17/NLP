As this year's intake of students begin to arrive at their various universities, check into their halls of residence (apart from the University of Lincoln which appears not to have matched rooms to students and temporary accommodation is required) and begin the mad social whirl that is Freshers' Week, I am reminded of my son's experience at university some thirteen years ago.Within a couple of weeks of the beginning of his first term, several cases of meningitis were discovered among the students - and other universities had similar clusters.Needless to say, parents were extremely alarmed and anxious for their children and it was a very worrying time. The university student health department went into immediate action and the newspapers carried pictures of students lining up for the Men C inoculation. Luckily for us, my son had the jab and did not contract the disease - but I often wonder what happened to those students who were not so fortunate.Since then - and because of such large numbers of students being affected in the outbreak - the Men C jab has become part of the vaccination package for all young people. However, this only offers protection from one strain of the infection. There are no vaccines for the other types - A, B, W135 and Y - all of which are extremely serious illnesses. Viral meningitis is not so serious and rarely proves fatal.Meningitis occurs when the lining of the brain and spinal chord becomes inflamed - and septicaemia is the blood poisoning form of the disease.The after-effects can be devastating - if the patient recovers, it may be with the loss of limbs, sight or hearing.Next week - 19th-25th September - is Meningitis Awareness Week. "Counting the Cost of Meningitis" is the current campaign run by The Meningitis Research Foundation. The campaign spells out only too clearly the possible results of contracting meningitis. The charity is calling on the government to "introduce a Men B vaccine to the Childhood Immunisation Schedule - as soon as a safe and effective one becomes available". Researchers have a result in their sights, which makes the appeal to the government all the more important.For more information about meningitis, please log onto www.meningitis.org or for MRF's viral video, which explains why your support is vital and asks you to sign the petition, log onto www.meningitis.org/sign
