There's been  recently about whether householders should be able to let out spare rooms in their homes to strangers on a short-term basis.Many councils have been  despite the fact we have an abundance of empty bedrooms literally spread all over Australia.Trawling through the 9500-plus Australian listings on US-based accommodation website Airbnb, it's clear plenty of people are already quietly making money from the extra space in their homes.Melbourne resident Loren O'Keeffe uses Airbnb to rent out the spare room of the two-bedroom Richmond apartment she co-owns with her partner.The 28-year-old took the plunge into house sharing to meet interesting people and after three years and 300 guests, the experience has met expectations."We've met opera singers, doctors and lawyers from all over the world," she says. "We never imagined we'd meet such a great array of people, it has been absolutely fantastic."Airbnb, which takes a three per cent cut on bookings made, has also helped the Victorian duo earn an extra $50,000 - money which O'Keeffe says has been vital to meeting loan repayments on the apartment's initial $300,000 mortgage."We wouldn't have been able to pay the mortgage without [Airbnb]," O'Keeffe says.While the potential extra income is impressive, renting out shared personal space has its downsides.Hosts (and guests) need a huge amount of trust. Hosts have to keep their homes spick-and-span and guest-ready, and be on-hand to offer advice on things like where to eat and local attractions.O'Keeffe's $75 per night charge covers use of a spare bedroom and basic facilities but breakfast and other meals are not included."We like to try to keep things simple," she says."The fact is that people come to see the city, they don't tend to want to hang about our apartment ... we've got good cafes and lots to do on our doorstep."Sydney host Al (who does not wish to reveal his surname), lives alone, and advertises five of the six-bedrooms in the Earlwood property that he owns.The 54-year-old management consultant includes breakfast as part of his $45 per night room fee. He says shared short-term accommodation is more about the opportunity to engage with different people than making money for the homeowner.As well as the social benefits of hosting, Al says listing on Airbnb is a good way to test out if running a bed-and-breakfast style operation - a concept he may formally take up in the future, is something he's cut out for."I've actually found guests and the experience so far to be really good," he says.Would-be hosts need get their heads around the personal and capital gains tax implications of any extra income and also local council and body corporate rulings on short-term and/or holiday rentals, as guidelines vary for different areas and even from one building to another.O'Keeffe sees short-term home sharing is akin to having a boarder."Since we are the only owner-occupiers in our building... [seeking permission] wasn't something we even considered, to be honest," she says.
