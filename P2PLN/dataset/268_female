If there's one thing for certain about spring - apart from blooming flowers - it's a fresh batch of properties hitting the market.If you plan to sell, these tips could help.It's essential to get the asking price right.The best way to get to know your local market is to look at properties in your immediate area, and research those that have recently sold (in the last few months). You can see sold listings Remember to compare like for like - and be realistic about whether your property is up to the same level as the others you see.Sometimes asking for less can yield a better result.Take  at 3/28 Rickard Avenue, Mosman, NSW.It sold in May for $760,000, two weeks after hitting the market with an asking price of $745,000-plus.A couple of months earlier, when the three-bedroom, one-bathroom unit was on the market with a different agent, it had the much higher asking price of $795,000. Then, the highest offer was $737,000.Of course, in property sales nothing is black and white, and in the case of this apartment, it is hard to say that pricing alone made the difference.When the owner switched agents, the apartment was also styled to make it feel bigger and brighter, which the agent, Adam Vernon of Belle Property Mosman, says potentially had the biggest impact."We pay very close attention to the photos to make sure the property is presented in its very best light. It's the marketing that brings in the buyers so the photos have to be perfect," Vernon says."We changed the furniture around to reconfigure the flow of the apartment, added a couple of hanging pictures and cushions and moved some chunky furniture out to highlight the space. We then re-shot the property."These are low-cost changes that have a direct knock-on effect to the sale price. Great presentation in your marketing leads to more buyers at your opens, leading to greater competition and a premium sale price."Vendor Kylie MacDonald, who is in the midst of selling her five-bedroom, two-bathroom  on the outskirts of Bendigo in Victoria, had a simple strategy in choosing an agent - go for one with something to prove.After a run of troubles with agents during previous property sales, MacDonald this time opted to engage Jesse Gardner, the new sales manager of her local branch of Barry Plant.MacDonald figured that because Gardner had just switched employers from another agency in town, he'd be out to make an impression."There has been a lot of issues with a lot of different agents, but this fellow we've got now is really good," she says.It's always advisable to see at least three agents before deciding who you will go with.If you've not met them before - or even if you have - attend one or two of their open houses to see how well they communicate, whether they are engaging, and if they bother to follow you up.When Sydneysider Belinda Russell and her husband decided to put in Cowles Road, Mosman up for auction, they wanted to put their best foot forward.Although their agent, Priscilla Ouvrier from McGrath, had advised that not a lot needed to be done to the renovated property (except disappearing the kids' plastic cubby from the backyard), Russell had most of the inside of the home repainted, and some of the exterior too.She also had the timber floors re-sanded and repolished."That gives it a really nice little facelift," says Russell, who completed the tidy-up by pressure washing the pavers and cleaning all the windows "so that it looks nice and sparkly, and lets as much light in as we possibly can".Nobody lives in a show home, so when it comes time to sell it helps to find somewhere to stow your daily detritus out of sight.Russell, who has three children under six, gave away some unneeded items such as an oversupply of stuffed toys, and is storing bigger, but necessary pieces such as high chairs in the rear shed during open houses."It's still our home but you've got to strip it back a little so that when potential buyers come they can start thinking 'oh this could be our home'," she says.Most of the family photos that came down for the house to be painted didn't go back up. But one thing stayed: Belinda's loud wallpaper (see gallery)."There's some pretty crazy wallpaper, which I thought the agents would have said 'get rid of it, make it more of a blank canvas for people' but they didn't," she says. "The thing is, it's just a bit of wallpaper that people realise they can just get rid of if they want to."1. Get your paperwork in order early, and choose a solicitor as soon as possible.2. Professional photographs. Even if your agent is handy with a camera, it is worth the expense of using a professional photographer. As agent Adam Vernon says above, getting the lighting right and shooting rooms from their best angles makes a world of difference.3. Sell your best points. Don't try to squeeze everything about your property into the wording of online and print ads - just the really juicy stuff.But do have an information pack available at open houses with further details about the property and its surrounding area for interested lookers to take away.4. Be flexible with openings. Although it can be painful, being prepared to show potential buyers through your home at inconvenient times will help to widen your net of people looking.Â
