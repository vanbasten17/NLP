On the Dallas City Council's "to do" list when it reconvenes after the July break is to select an executive search firm to find candidates to consider for its next city manager, a job Mary Suhm recently left. (Assistant City Manager A.C. Gonzalez is filling in on an interim basis and is the favorite of many inside City Hall.)Down in Aggieland, the city of College Station is also searching for a new city manager. Among the tools it is using is an online request from the City Council to hear from citizens about what experience and qualifications they think are important in the the next city manager.Interesting idea, particularly if the College Station City Council actually takes into account the responses it receives from residents as it looks for its next City Hall boss.As our editorial board considers our own plans in regard to the Dallas CM search, what do readers want to see in the process? And what do you think Dallas needs in its next city manager?
