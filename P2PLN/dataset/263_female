It's awards time of year again in property world - which means plenty of opportunities to drool over homes around the nation.One of the latest shows has been the Master Builders Awards in NSW - where winners range from lower-priced renovations and builds, through to mansions with carved marble baths.If nothing else, it offers a fantastic chance to take a peek into a world that most of us will never be able to afford (such as homes in the $10 million category).In the NSW Master Builders Awards, the top accolade was taken out for an incredibly difficult job on Sydney's foreshore, which involved underpinning a 1939 harbourfront apartment block while excavating three metres below sea level close a curving sea wall. The aim was to  install an expansive underground car park in a building where no parking had previously existed.Successfully completing it - while keeping all seven owners and their individual architects happy - won Artarmon builder Pimas Gale Construction the esteemed title of Master Builder of the Year.The brief for the triple-storey Point Piper apartment complex included reinforcing the seawall, expanding the oceanfront swimming pool, adding an eighth apartment and upgrading some of the existing units.The renovation of the existing dwellings included removing supporting walls and introducing structural steel."The project was a huge challenge for any builder," says Master Builders Association of NSW Excellence in Housing Awards judge Peter Court.As well as winning Master Builder of the Year, the impressive project also took out the award for Home Unit - Renovation, $5Million  Over.The work involved battling harbour tides and winds on the peninsula of Point Piper, and at one stage, dealing with a huge influx of water seeping through the existing seawall, which had to be plugged during construction. Constant dewatering was also required during the  project to get rid of water splashing over the top of the seawall."It was amazingly complicated" says Court. "For most of the first year, two separate engineers were employed on the site to control the major engineering works that were required."The Point Piper project was completed on a fixed-price contract.Pimas Gale installed a new lift over five levels, and constructed a curving Italian marble staircase leading up from the foyer. The façade of the building was also enhanced with curved glass, true to its art deco heritage.Perhaps the most stunning part of the work is also the most visible - a huge oval infinity-edge swimming pool that links seamlessly with the harbour, and the Harbour Bridge beyond.On the other side of Sydney, an impressive Mosman project landed Erskineville company Sandlik Constructions the award for Contract Houses, $10 Million  Over.After two houses were demolished, 4000 cubic metres of rock had to be excavated to make way for a new three-level residence.Many of the materials for the new home were craned in, and when the crane couldn't reach far enough, items were shipped to the property's foreshore on a barge. The cladding for an external stone wall required 800 crane lifts alone.The project was so complicated that a site foreman with a background as an architect was used.The 24-month job involved having stonemasons on site for an entire year. For the bathrooms, dozens of blocks of luxury Calacatta marble were inspected before settling on one suitable for carving a bath.The landscaping was completed by  designer William Dangar.At the more affordable end of the market, a good-quality family home won Mudgee builder Anthony Lynch the prestigious title of Young Builder of the Year.Lynch's four-bedroom, two-bathroom entry also took out Contract Houses - up to $500,000, and Best Use of Brick. Main features of the property included traditional raked eaves finished with timber lining boards, ironbark flooring and decking, custom joinery and a recessed gas heater in the living area.The judges were particularly impressed with Lynch's faultless brickwork.The property had heated bathroom floors, a 2.5 kilowatt grid-connected solar system, a ducted vacuum cleaner, ducted air-conditioning, hard-wired smoke detectors and an in-ground swimming pool.Outside, a 3000-litre rainwater tank was connected to the toilets, laundry and garden.Judges said the finishes in the bathrooms and the kitchen were faultless.Despite all of the modern inclusions, Court says the 275 sq m home was built at "a very reasonable rate" and the building cost came in at under $400,000.
