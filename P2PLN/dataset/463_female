Walk the Walk - the charity best known for the Moonwalks, which involve people power-walking the marathon course, through the night, in the most eccentric bras possible, to raise money for breast cancer - has topped £75 million in donations in the 15 years since Nina Barough first had the idea.This amazing amount of money has been extremely carefully allotted to projects round the country. Breakthrough Breast Cancer has been one recipient and, following the opening of the Toby Robins Unit in 1999, there is now a Pathology Laboratory named after Nina Barough. Here, researchers work to identify molecules in biopsies, which can help to predict how the disease will progress and Walk the Walk also helps fund the Generation Study (following 100,000 women and men over 40 years).After care, complementary therapy and support charities like The Haven and Penny Brohn in Bristol, have both received donations - which enables them to offer more therapies free of charge - and the Christie NHS Foundation has received £45,000 to develop its own complementary therapy unit.In Scotland, a whole new cancer ward has been funded at The Western Infirmary in Edinburgh and the second Maggie's in Glasgow was built with the help of Walk the Walk.Last week I paid a second visit to Breast Cancer Campaign's Tissue Bank which is hugely grateful to Walk the Walk for donating £2 million.Having found the first experience utterly fascinating, I was delighted to be invited again. I was in the company of some of Walk the Walk's power-walkers, who had come to see how their "hard-walked" money was being spent. Both Nina Barough and Baroness Delyth Morgan (CEO of Breast Cancer Campaign) joined us, as did Walk the Walk's ambassador, the actress Harriet Thorpe (best known by my TV generation as the wonderfully vulnerable Carol in "The Brittas Empire"), brought her close friend, Jennifer Saunders - who is recovering from breast cancer.Wearing white coats, we toured the laboratories and were shown how a sample of tumour - which we watched Professor Louise Jones remove from the results of a patient's mastectomy - is then divided into slivers and used for research.We looked down microscopes at cells and Jenny Gomm, the Cell Isolation Scientist, showed us how she separates the cells, thereby allowing each type to be used for research. We heard from Sally Smith - the Tissue Bank researcher who talks to the patient about using his or her tissue - how it can be tricky to judge the right time to make the request. Apart from religious reasons, most people do not hesitate to agree. After all, this is tissue that, otherwise, would be thrown away - which would be a huge waste and, having seen how many different tests can be done on the tissue, this is an enormous step forward for breast cancer research.At the moment, only patients in the four centres of the Tissue Bank - Barts in London, Dundee, Nottingham and Leeds - can offer their tissue, but Dr Val Speirs , who heads the Leeds Tissue Bank, told me that two more centres will be joining soon. Trials are under way - based on an American process - to find a way to transport the fresh tissue safely and quickly. If that works, the tissue (which needs to be tested as fresh tissue before it is either put into formalin or frozen) could be transported further, which will mean many more than the estimated 1400 tumours will be available each year.The Tissue Bank Trekkers are taking part in the Moonwalks again this year - both in London and Edinburgh. Part of the aim of Walk the Walk is to encourage all of us - not only cancer sufferers - to go out there and exercise, whether or not you take part in a fundraising walk.www.walkthewalk.org
