
	As the dying season of fall begins, we need to cherish every moment of life.
	Three people in the news this week would treasure even one more living breath.
	This time last week, all were living vital lives, and they are now tragically gone.
	About 4:30 p.m. Thursday, Jill Tarlov of Fairfield, Conn., was crossing West Drive in Central Park near 63rd St. when a bicyclist named Jason Marshall, 31, barreled along the roadway screaming for her to get out of his way. Too late. He smashed into Tarlov. Her head struck the asphalt road. She lost consciousness and was taken to New York-Presbyterian Hospital Weill Cornell, where she was placed on a ventilator. She died Monday.
	I felt that family's pain because eight years ago, my kid brother Joey was on a ventilator in North Shore University Hospital with zero brain activity. I held his hand with my family as doctors shut off the machine, and I watched him take his final breath of life. A sound that will stay with me forever.
	"My wife was beautiful in every way imaginable," said a statement from Tarlov's husband, CBS executive Mike Wittman. "Jill was the most amazing mother to Matthew and Anna, who taught them above all that kindness, compassion and a spirit for life were the right morals to live by."
	One hopes Tarlov's spirit will live on.
	Early Sunday morning, Officer Michael Williams, a rookie with nine months on the NYPD under his gun belt, was in a police van with eight other cops heading west on Bruckner Blvd. in the Bronx for a security detail in Manhattan. Rain slicked the streets of Hunts Point. As the driver switched lanes he lost control, hitting a barrier under the Sheridan Expressway. Williams was ejected from the vehicle. His head struck the roadway. It would be the final tour for this dedicated young police officer who never saw his heartbreaking death coming.
	"Williams' dream was to be an NYPD officer," said Mayor de Blasio. "He came from a police family. This is what he wanted to do with his life."
	At 5 p.m. Sunday in the Baseball Heaven complex in Yaphank, L.I., Richard Becher, a loving father and a dedicated coach of his son's youth baseball team was throwing warmup pitches to kids from behind a protective "L-screen." A kid roped a line drive. Somehow it struck Becher's head, a fatal freak accident.
	"He died doing something he totally loved, being involved in his kid's life," his brother-in-law John Bree, 51, told the Daily News.
	Two years ago, I stood with a friend in a batting cage and saw his teenage son get hit with a line drive to the head. My friend rushed his son for a brain scan. The boy was OK. After hearing about Becher's death, my friend said, "You never think it's gonna be you. But sometimes it is you."
	You look for villains. You want to point fingers. But all you are left with is three vital human lives lost too soon in the first week of the dying season of fall.
	Which makes you want to cherish every blessed moment of this unpredictable thing called life.
