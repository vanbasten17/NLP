	How to pass for one of us so you don't get taken, laughed at, or beat up:
	1. It might be spelled like the city in Texas, but we don't say "Houston," we say "How-stin." If you ask a cabbie to take you to "Houston" he may drive you cross-country — with the meter running.
	2. A bagel with a schmeer means just that: A plain bagel with a thick blanket of cream cheese.
	3. If the middle light is out on the call light atop a cab, it means it's occupied. Put your hand down.
	4. If you start waving around like a crazed cheerleader for a cab, they'll know you're a tourist and take you the seven blocks to your destination via the GWB.
	5. Pineapple on pizza is a mortal sin. Don't do it. End of discussion.
	6. A classic New York treat is an egg cream. It has neither eggs nor cream. It's just chocolate milk with seltzer. And it's delicious.
	7. When ordering coffee at an outdoor cart, it's "light," "black" or "regular." You can add "sweet" if you like sugar. You are even permitted to say "5 sugars," or whatever. Nothing more is required. Period.
	8. You can pay $10 for a cronut at a fancy bakery or you can pay a buck fifty for a donut and a croissant at Dunkin' Donuts and smush them together. Up to you.
	9. Our new traffic lanes are designed so that if you get out of a car on the left, you'll get run down by a bike, and if get out on the right you'll get run down by a car. Take the damned subway, OK?
	10. If you ask for a blueberry bagel you might get beat up.
	11. If you go to Little Italy and say "fuhgeddaboudit" you should get beat up.
	12. Listen up: It's pronounced "soda" — not "sowdaa." Who talks like that?
	13. No one calls Sixth Avenue "Avenue of the Americas." No one.
