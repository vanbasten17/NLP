UPDATE: DMN's Robert Wilonsky writes that Dallas-based 7-11 has joined Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid and other national chains in refusing to stock the issue. Also, see Boston Magazine's "photo rebuttal" to Rolling Stone's cover.
Some years ago, our editorial staff occasionally produced a "photo editorial." These were cases in which a cutline and photo was all we needed to make our point.Today I'm bringing the idea back on the blog:This Rolling Stone cover is irresponsible and disrespectful to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing. What does the way Tsarnaev is portrayed on the cover convey, even indirectly, to our own children about character, status and standing?Even if this cover turns out to be the most thorough and groundbreaking profile of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ever published, the use of this celebrity-rock-star-style photo is wrong. I hate it when we in the publishing world veer from provocative into anything that will cause a stir or sell more of a publication.And, yes, I know the Rolling Stone photo is from Tsarnaev's own FaceBook page. And that it's appeared elsewhere. None of that makes this cover OK.Its placement in this iconic spot under the even more iconic "Rolling Stone" nameplate makes me ill. The intent may have been to show how "The Bomber" looks just like any other American teen, but the result is that many readers will carry this image with them, not the image of the dozens of limbs that were blown off victims. How about a photo of young Martin Richard, who died in the blast, on the cover instead?In its attempt to defend its cover, Rolling Stone wants us to recall the controversy of previous covers, particularly the Charles Manson cover. I'll let you be the judge, but none of the controversial covers of the past made killers out to look like young Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen, circa 1978.
