Homebuyers, already hit with a crisis of confidence that has dented the property market over the last year, will take no joy from the hammering shares are receiving around the world.But many economists are ruling out the dramatic double interest rate cuts that have been predicted by financial markets, with HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham labelling the markets "very dislocated"."The Reserve Bank told us as recently as their Thursday-night finalised statement of monetary policy that they're worried about inflation rising, they're worried about a mining investment boom and inflation looks as though it's going to pick up to well above what the Reserve Bank is comfortable with," Bloxham says."It's hard to imagine them cutting interest rates as soon as September."Although Bloxham agrees that "things can move quite quickly", HSBC is still pegging local interest rates to remain on hold."The China story is still about a huge amount of investment in Australia in terms of mining investment and that is driving up inflation ... so we expect that at some point [the Reserve Bank will] be lifting interest rates again," he says."Of course, the uncertainty in the financial markets over the last few days has been quite acute and it makes it very difficult to know whether that's a genuine sign that the economy is going to turn down, or whether that's just financial market volatility, and so at this stage we'd say [rates are] on hold for the moment but we still expect the next move is up, rather than down."That is at odds with Westpac chief economist Bill Evans who is predicting a rate cut this side of Christmas. And today's moves from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac to cut fixed rates could indicate the institutions see a rate fall ahead.As to how the turmoil will affect the housing market, Bloxham says there's two ways of looking at it.If the Reserve Bank were to cut interest rates, it would be because the economy looks as though it has weakened substantially.That would mean "people are probably losing their jobs, which is of course not necessarily particularly good for the housing market in the short run", Bloxham says. But on the plus side, it lowers borrowing costs and makes housing more affordable - assuming you still have a job.However, if rates do as Bloxham predicts and sit tight, the housing market should stay "broadly flat".Angie Zigomanis, a property analyst for BIS Shrapnel, says it's still hard to tell what the fallout of the upset in the markets will be.If you compare it with the GFC, the housing sector suffered a sharp downturn in 2008 "more so due to decreased sentiment and increased caution from homebuyers", Zigomanis says."But ultimately the fundamentals behind the market were relatively strong in the sense dwelling stock [had] underlying deficiencies across most capital city markets."Zigomanis too thinks that unless things deteriorate "a lot" between now and the Reserve Bank's next meeting in September, rates will probably remain unchanged."A rate cut is not always a good thing," he says.Andrew Wilson, a senior economist with Australian Property Monitors (owned by Fairfax Media) says the uncertainty comes "at the point where the major markets of Sydney and Melbourne are just starting to look a bit more confident"."They're obviously still in that correction phase but it's certainly nothing like some [people] seemed to think, that we were going to have a very large collapse in house prices, which was never on the cards," Wilson says.But confidence is a easy to crack."Sentiment is a very fragile thing and one of the things we've seen in our markets, in our housing market, or generally in our economy, is that buyers and consumers have become a lot more prudent over the last couple of years, as a consequence of the GFC," Wilson says."This will just dampen what is already a subdued consumer environment ... It reinforces that little niggle, that little doubt, that things aren't really yet as good as we've been told they are going to be."If Australia does hit a downturn, the nation has the interest rate trigger to pull to boost the economy, but Zigomanis doesn't think the government will be able to ramp up housing sales like it did during the global financial crisis."Back in 2008 we had a lot of pent-up first-home buyer demand that was there and was able to be released by the increased first-home owner bonuses and the lower interest rates," Zigomanis says. "We won't necessarily be able to trigger activity at the bottom end of the market as easily as we could a couple of years ago."Wilson suggests a wait-and-see approach."We need to take a deep breath, a cold shower and look at exactly what the situation is. It still is that we have very low unemployment in most centres, we have a mining boom bigger than we've ever had before and still have a very strong major export client in China," he says."Given all those aspects, I would suggest that a downward move in interest rates would really signal a very severe international economic incident."
