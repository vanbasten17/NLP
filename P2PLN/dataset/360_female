The virus which produces a foghorn cough - and from which most of the UK population seems to be suffering - attacked me some six weeks ago, disappeared for ten days and has now returned with a vengeance. Hence this rather late blog post about Ovarian Cancer during Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month - for which I apologise.We are now moving towards the end of March, when the charity spotlight shines on the work of the Ovarian Cancer charities and does its best to illuminate our understanding of this cancer, which is the fifth most common cancer in the UK with nearly 7,000 women diagnosed each year. Survival rates are poor - only 40 per cent of patients live beyond five years from diagnosis. Most cases are found in post-menopausal women but, as in other cancers, younger women are also being diagnosed.Unfortunately, ovarian cancer is easily misdiagnosed. Its symptoms are unpredictable and, initially, could be mistaken for those of Irritable Bowel Syndrome. It seems that too many GP's take that option and the patient may have to return a good many times before a referral is made. I read recently of a lady who saw her GP on 31 occasions before her symptoms were taken seriously.Shockingly, a recent study found that over 90 per cent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer did not know the symptoms of the disease before their diagnosis - and too many believed, erroneously, that the smear test would detect ovarian as well as cervical cancer. Clearly, there is a good deal of work to be done to raise awareness of this disease and its symptoms.Ovarian Cancer Action, which has its research centre at Imperial College in London, offer a description of symptoms:Bloating, Abdominal Pain, Loss of Appetite, Feeling Full Quickly, Change in bowel and bladder habits.Recent research suggests that causes can include obesity, not having children - or having the first child over the age of 30, not breast feeding, starting menstruation before the age of 12, starting the menopause over the age of 50, using HRT and not using the contraceptive pill (it is thought that, by using the pill and not ovulating, the ovaries are not overworked).I am not sure how helpful it is to know possible causes when so many of them are not in your gift to change - which is the same with many suggested causes of breast cancer.Ovacome - which is the UK's information and support charity for ovarian cancer - condenses the symptoms to four main ones:B - for bloating, which is persistent and does not come and go
E - for eating less and feeling fuller
A - for abdominal pain
T - for telling your GPThe acronym BEAT is the headline for Ovacome's campaign to raise awareness. Sue Rizzello emailed me and said:"All around the UK and Ireland there are a group of people (sufferers, survivors, supporters and siblings) who are literally pounding the BEAT for Ovarian Cancer symptoms, which is promoted by a small but significant support network charity called Ovacome. Their stories could make you cry and certainly could make them cry - instead they are at work.They are engaging with their local gyms and other businesses, demanding action from local GPs, putting on displays in hospitals and clinics, writing to their local MPs, coming up with amazing health policy ideas to help get the message about early warning symptoms to the 50 per cent of the population which NEEDS to know them. As well as organising fundraising events, starting marathon training and other 'normal' charity activities. They don't only do this in Ovarian Cancer Month - it's a constant, energetic process which has engaged many people who only had an OC scare but for whom it was a wake-up call."I checked on Ovacome's website and found a BEAT symptom tracker which can be used. It has three easy stages - set-up, track your symptoms over time, and print the results to take to your GP.From the list of symptoms, it is possible to see why a GP might not rush to an instant diagnosis and his or her wariness might be heightened by the result of the only test available. The CA125 protein, which has raised levels with ovarian cancer, is not itself a sufficiently accurate diagnostic tool. The protein can be raised by other benign conditions, by menstruation or by pregnancy. A vaginal ultrasound can show up the ovaries but not differentiate between cancer and a cyst.There is a long way to go but the Ovarian Cancer charities are working hard to communicate information, raise awareness and support those diagnosed.Apart from Ovacome and Ovarian Cancer Action, Target Ovarian Cancer, The Eve Appeal and Wellbeing of Women have information should you need it.If you would like to join Ovacome's ladies on the BEAT, collect a poster for your GP's surgery, tell your story or speak to a nurse, log onto the charity's website.There will be many women remembered this month and, in my household, one particular friend for whom ovarian cancer was not diagnosed early enough, whose strength and positivity were an example to us all, but whose life was ended far too soon in August of last year.Let us hope that an understanding of this terrible disease will be possible in the not too distant future.
