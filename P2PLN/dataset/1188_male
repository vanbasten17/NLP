Politicians in India usually give bangles, saris, electrical goods  and even lap tops away at election time in order to woo voters. Sonia  Gandhi has raised the bar this week with a $20bn-plus total food handout that has  taken several percentage points off the value of the rupee and the stock  market, and demolished successful efforts last Friday by Palaniappan  Chidambaram, the finance minister, to halt the slide in the country's  economy.She did this on Monday night (right) by pushing through  the Lok Sabha a Food Security Bill that is primarily aimed at giving her  dynasty and the Congress Party political security by persuading India's  poor that Congress is their best bet for a better life. Her eyes are on  the general election due next March or April, and she hopes that bags  of grain will wipe away memories of slowing growth, rising prices,  endemic corruption, somnolent government, and all the other economic problems (as Andrew Buncombe reported last week) that have beset the coalition that she heads.This  drove India's currency to record low yesterday of Rs66.24 against the  dollar and Rs105 against the pound sterling, compared to the levels of  Rs63.3 and Rs98.5 that Chidambaram's measures and statement had achieved  last Friday. Today more records have been broken - over Rs67.5 and  Rs106.5."Madam Gandhi must have been quite a force to reckon  with," historians will say, when hearing about such a sacrifice for the  poor and its impact on India's uncomfortably high current account  deficit!Cynics would say that it would be brave for a dynasty  that is set on perpetuating its rule to do anything else but to  perpetuate the conditions that enable it to present itself as the  guardian of the poor and under-privileged. Is it instinctive for an  elite to maintain conditions as they are, modulating progress so that  the apple cart on which it is perched does not topple over? I am not  suggesting that Sonia Gandhi consciously plots policies that would keep  the poor poor, but that is the logic of what she has done in recent  years, advised by her aid-oriented National Advisory Council that  designed this bill, instead of pushing reforms and subsidy cuts that  would spur economic growth (now down to near 5% from 9%).And whether it is conscious or instinctive, as I wrote on this blog last year, Rahul  Gandhi has been heard saying that the way to keep Congress in power is  to channel subsidies and funds to the poor, irrespective of how wasteful  that could be, while discouraging growth-oriented economic reforms that  might do short-term harm to Congress's pro-poor image.The Bill guarantees 5 kg of rice, wheat and cereals per  month at fixed low prices to some 70% of the 1.2bn population.   Government estimates suggest that this will cost Rs 1,24,723 crore per  year (around $20bn and £12bn) but other estimates go as high as twice  that. Surjit Bhalla, a economics commentator, puts the figure at' Rs 3,14,000 crore or around 3% of GDP.That  is on top of a hefty government budget for food allocation and  subsidies, much of which is wasted or siphoned off by corrupt officials  as the money travels down to villages. The government admitted in  parliament this week that 20% to 30% of food is lost with leakages from  the public distribution system.The Food Bill is of course an easy  high profile measure to introduce, emulating the way that politicians  lay foundations stones without worrying about whether projects are  actually built and well maintained. The much harder task would be to tackle what really ails the poor, which  is malnutrition and the supply of clean-safe drinking water, improved  sanitation, and piped sewerage or other hygienic systems to avoid  outbreak of water-borne diseases.Food schemes can be administered  efficiently, as has been shown in the state of Chhattisgarh where the  management of the public distribution system's ration shops was shifted  from private licensees to community-based organizations such as gram  panchayats (village councils,) female self-help groups and co-operative  societies. "We organize a Chawal Utsav (Rice Festival) at each ration  shop during the first week of every month, which helps to ensure that  all food items are adequately stocked in each shop by the last day of  the previous month," Raman Singh, chief minister, told the Wall Street Journal.  Food is delivered direct to the shops to help curtail leakages and the  system is computerised. That policy was adopted in Chhattisgarh as part  of a broad approach to economic change and was not a stand-alone policy  like Sonia Gandhi's.Sonia publicly launched the Food Bill last  week (as part of the Congress Party platform for coming assembly  elections in the state of Delhi) on the birth anniversary of her  husband, Rajiv Gandhi, even though he focussed in the 1980s as prime  minister on more constructive economic growth policies. So this measure  is not really a credit to his memory. I wonder if he would approve!John Elliott's Riding the Elephant blog is on http://ridingtheelephant.wordpress.com/
