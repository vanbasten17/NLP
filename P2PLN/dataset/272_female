With spring fast approaching, sellers thinking of taking their property to market will already be in preparation mode.But what exactly can they expect from the traditional selling season? Will it be all doom and gloom, or are things looking up?Andrew Wilson, the senior economist at Australian Property Monitors (owned by Fairfax Media), gives his insights on what is happening in Australia's capital city markets.There's growing confidence in the Sydney market,Â  Wilson says. "There's still some quiet areas but I think the prospects for spring are quite optimistic from vendors.".Australian Property Monitors figures show modest price growth in Sydney over the June quarter and clearance rates for weekend auctions have picked up recently."We've got clearance rates averaging above 60 per cent now in July," Wilson says. That's higher than a year ago when clearance rates were in the mid 50s.The action is mostly in the middle part of the market rather than the top end - although there are early signs of a rise in activity for pricier properties, particularly in the eastern suburbs and lower north shore, says Wilson."Leading indicators are quite positive and particularly compared to last spring where the market really did run out of puff."Of course, the key disclaimer to all of this is how the economy is performing and we've just started to see some more positive signs from the economy as well."Melbourne has been a little surprising this year performing better than expected, says Wilson."Melbourne really leapt ahead back in that boom period we had in 2009 into 2010," Wilson says. "Certainly that was unsustainable and [there has been] a correction process."However, an increase in first home buyers due to changes in incentives by the Victorian Government has created a "drawing forward in demand". "That has helped to bolster the market recently," says Wilson.But the jury is still out on how the Melbourne market will do over the remainder of the year."We may see a little bit of that middle market pick up through to the end of the year as a result of people who have sold their properties to first home buyers," says Wilson.On the whole though, Wilson is expecting the Melbourne market to remain subdued.Despite a solid lift in home loans and investor activity in Queensland, Australian Property Monitors is not seeing any sense of a liftoff the bottom of the market."We're still seeing a decline in prices growth," says Wilson.APM's latest price report shows Brisbane's median house price dropped for the eighth consecutive quarter."That's two years of falling house prices in Brisbane, so we couldn't really say that we're seeing a sense of a recovery in house prices in Brisbane at this stage," says Wilson.Adelaide is quite flat at the moment, says Wilson."There's a real wait-and-see attitude amongst buyers and sellers in the Adelaide market," he says."I would suggest that it would still remain quite flat over the remainder of the year with, if anything, some slight upside in terms of prices growth and increased buyer activity."Perth is ticking all right boxes for sellers, says Wilson."All the fundamentals are certainly pointing to prices growth. Western Australia has Australia's strongest economy, lowest unemployment rate and highest wages."We're seeing significant rises in rents for both units and houses in the Perth market, a shortage of accommodation and high competition for properties in both the selling and renting markets."Strong population growth and low levels of construction are at play."Once you get behind that eight-ball of construction to meet underlying demand it's very hard to catch up and that does put pressure on prices," says Wilson."There's certainly some growing momentum in the Perth market and I would be surprised if we didn't see quite solid prices growth in that market through until the end of the year."It is certainly the hot spot in Australian capital cities at the moment."The Canberra market is up and running, says Wilson.Wilson says Canberra has low unemployment, relatively high public service incomes and a shortage of accommodation, especially at the cheaper end of the market."You have a very strong mid-range price market, it's a very difficult market to enter," Wilson says."First home buyers find it very hard to get into the marketplace in Canberra, and it is certainly, in terms of prices growth, looking very, very solid at the moment."It's probably number two to Perth."Darwin tends to be pretty volatile, says Wilson."It has a very seasonal employment profile because of the dry and the wet season there, so you tend to get a lot of interstate migration as the wet season moves into the dry season and vice-versa."The underlying trend in Darwin is increased activity in the resources sector, especially offshore resources, says Wilson."We'll see quite an active market through to spring in Darwin," he says.Despite a weaker economy that lacks exposure to the mainland's resources boom, Wilson says the Hobart housing market has shown some resilience."Buyer confidence is holding up in the market in Tasmania at the moment but it will be interesting to see whether it can continue to do so given that the prospects for the local economy are still mixed at best."At the end of the day it's confidence in the local economy, it's jobs growth, it's incomes growth; these sorts of factors determine, certainly over the medium term, where housing markets go."
