Heading to staff meeting momentarily and, top of mind as we talk about what to editorial about, is this:Let's challenge people who care about the city and its past — especially Preservation Dallas — to be more pro-active when it comes to the demolition of our city's past. Even when buildings need to come down, can we as a city show a little more TLC?Robert Wilonsky, who covered the demolition for the DMN, says many folks have known for two months that this building was coming down.1611 Main Street was one of downtown Dallas' oldest buildings — until yesterday when, Dallas Demolition indeed demolished it. The building, though standing since 1885,  had no local historic designation. Coldly put, that means the owners could do what they wanted with the building, in this case knocking down the building so land would be available to continue the Joule hotel expansion.So again, where is Preservation Dallas in all this? Was this really the best solution for this building and, if it was, couldn't more have been done to save some of the sandstone and wrought iron rather than just crushing it into a pile of rubble? I ask this not just rhetorically (although there is that) but in hopes that those questions get asked before the expected demolition of other buildings in the area of 1611 Main.In Robert's words, the demolition crew "massacred 1611 Main." "They didn't even empty the air conditioners of the freon, which shot everywhere when the wrecking ball hit em."Oh, and according to several who watched the demolition, there were no police officers anywhere.The city of Dallas has a sketchy track record when it comes to preserving its wonderful historic buildings. I'd like to see us, as a city, pay as much attention to events like yesterday as we do to the excitement around our award-winning skyline and Klyde Warren Park.
