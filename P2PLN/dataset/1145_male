There's a great clip doing the rounds of top US book designer Chip Kidd talking about why book jacket design is important. It's largely made of anecdotes relating to some of his greatest hits (Naked by David Sedaris, Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton, 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami) but the central point is that each book cover should answer the question: what does the story inside look like?Looking at Kidd's brilliant, idiosyncratic, one-off covers and thinking about this brought to mind David Horspool's recent post on the TLS blog about current trends in UK book covers, in which he points out that, generic though many of them are, they do at least try to keep our interest by refreshing the pool of stock images every now and then. So, just now, the store shelves are full of Â Legs books,  Backs of Women Looking out over Water books and Tiny Men Walking into the Distance books.While it's clear that these generic covers are dull in the extreme, and it must be desperately frustrating for authors to see their stories dressed up this way (and for designers to have their more interesting ideas vetoed by the marketing people) the thought occurs: what would it be like if all book covers were Chip Kidd covers?What if every book had the time and money lavished on it that Murakami, Crichton et al routinely see, all with the purpose of showing what the particular story inside looks like, rather than doing what generic covers do, which is show you what other books it's like?It would be like walking into a bookshop and having all those oh-so-reductive section labels removed, and every single work of fiction shelved in alphabetical order, romance next to sci-fi next to thriller next to literary fiction.Now, letting each story stand for itself, and giving each story the cover it deserves, might be better for us in the long run - it would stop us dismissing great books just because they're in a genre we think we don't like - but frankly we'd never get to the long run.The truth is, with the ever-increasing number of books being published, and the ever-shortening time they're in circulation, we need genres, and generic covers, to help us navigate our way through the morass. The cover is the frontline in the war between the art and commerce of literature, and in these ferocious times the publishers just want to grab our attention - it's just that different kinds of readers want their attention grabbing in different ways. Some want reassuring that the book is like other books they've liked in the past. Some want reassuring that the book is bracingly original (like all the other bracingly original books they've liked in the past.)What this means is that, brilliant as Chip Kidd's covers are (and you can choose your favourites, or suggest your favourites this side of the Atlantic, David Pearson or gray318) they really aren't just one-offs that refer only to the story inside the covers. They form a genre unto themselves - the Chip Kidd book - just like literary fiction is the name we give to the genre of books that hold themselves aloof from the petty concerns of genre.
