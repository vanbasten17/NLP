Well, this is just lovely. Much of what I write about on this blog is about design as an element of marketing, when how a book is made to look acts as an interface between the text inside and the world of the reader, but of course design can be more than simply effective, it can be beautiful in its own right, and that's what this is.Yellow Cab Quartet is a limited edition book work collaboration between writer Olivia Laing and illustrator/printer Anna Fewster. As a book, it's slender - just four short 'vignettes' about American writers taking journeys in New York cabs, together with nine monotype print illustrations. As an object, it's exquisite: the texture of the paper, that seems to give the text and image it carries so much more life than what you might find in your average book; the minimal debossing on the cover; the hand stitching of the pages. But all of that exquisiteness feeds straight back into its bookness - the loveliness of the design is there to make you appreciate the words and pictures, not to be cooed over for its own sake.The project is an off-shoot of Laing's second, forthcoming book, Echo Spring, an exploration of the connections between writers and booze. The pieces are evocative, speculative, interior, rather than objectively biographical, and give you a feel for the writer-drinker-heroes they describe, rather than an understanding of them. The images are equally elusive. With their uncertain blocks of grey and stray, deliberate lines, they look almost more like needlework than prints.The whole thing is handprinted by Fewster on her Adana 'Eight-Five' press (you can see pictures of it, and of her working it, on her website) and then meticulously put together. She says that she bought the press when she became interested in Virginia Woolf's printing activities, and the design decisions made by Fewster and Laing for the work were inspired by the time and place of the writers referenced - Scott Fitzgerald, and the poets John Berryman, Robert Lowell and Frank O'Hara.Fewster says:It's certainly heartening that this kind of dedicated work is still going on, though you'd have to shudder at the idea of anyone producing a full-length book, in a wider edition than the 100 copies there are of Yellow Cab Quartet.The process even for such a modest project sounds arduous:There's even the problem of not having enough physical letters for each page:
