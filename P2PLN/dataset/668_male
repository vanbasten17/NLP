Britain's manufacturers suffered a sharp slowdown last month as the Ukraine crisis showed the first signs of hitting the UK economy.A key monthly measure of business at Britain's factories hit a 14-month low, fanning fears that overall economic growth is tailing off after a strong first half to 2014.Manufacturing surveys from the eurozone, the UK's main trading partner, also painted a picture of deteriorating demand and shaken confidence on the continent.For the UK, news of pressure on exports deals a blow to government hopes of rebalancing the economy away from domestic consumer demand and towards more overseas trade.Bank of England data showed a big rise in lending to consumers in June, from £665m in the previous month to £1.1bn, providing more support to those who warn the UK is still overly reliant on household spending.The manufacturing report also pushes back expectations of when interest rates will rise from their record low, with many analysts now expecting early 2015 as the most likely date for an increase.The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI, a closely watched poll, showed factory output, orders and job creation had all come off recent highs. Export orders grew at the slowest pace for five months.Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said it was "becoming increasingly evident that UK industry is not immune to the impacts of rising geopolitical and global market uncertainty, especially when they affect economic growth and business confidence in our largest trading partner, the eurozone."It is noticeable that where export orders were reported to have risen, companies mainly linked this to demand from North America, Asia and the Middle East, as opposed to our European partners."The survey's main reading on factory activity was well below economists' forecasts, coming in at 52.5, down from 54.8 in July. That was still above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction but was the lowest since June last year.Manufacturing, which makes up a tenth of the economy, rebounded sharply earlier this year but remains below its pre-crisis levels. Economists said the latest report chimed with other business surveys suggesting growth will slow over the second half of the year.Thinktank Capital Economics highlighted headwinds for manufacturers from a strong pound and fragile confidence in the eurozone. But the sector was still on track for a solid year overall, said its UK economist Paul Hollingsworth."Despite signs of a near-term slowdown, we expect that the manufacturing sector's recovery should be bolstered by strong confidence, rising incomes and greater investment by firms," he said.But Rob Wood, chief UK economist at the private bank Berenberg, noted the risks to UK growth from tensions in Ukraine. "Russia's escalation of the conflict in Ukraine has taken a toll on the internationally exposed manufacturing sector, and that effect could yet worsen further in the coming months given recent confidence drops in the more directly exposed core European economies," he said. "These developments pose a serious downside risk to growth this year and next."Markit's PMI surveys from the eurozone again showed France's factories struggling in particular. For the currency bloc as a whole, the manufacturing sector recorded its weakest growth in 13 months. New orders and new export growth also slowed and the number of people employed across the manufacturing sector fell, adding to pressure on policymakers at the European Central Bank (ECB) to take more action to shore up growthin the region.France's PMI survey signalled the sharpest rate of decline for manufacturers since May 2013. Italy dropped back into contraction territory, while Spain and Germany both saw growth slow. In Ireland, however, the index hit a 15-year high."National data provided some bright spots, with the Irish numbers still buoyant and signs that Greece managed to move back into expansion territory. France remains a real concern though," said Dobson.Financial markets are now awaiting the related clutch of surveys on service industries  on Wednesday for further clues as to when the ECB will step in with more policy measures. Policymakers meet this week to discuss their options, but the ECB chief, Mario Draghi, recently made clear that the central bank cannot single-handedly solve the eurozone's problems. He has called on national governments to help with more growth-friendly policies.In the UK, the debate has centred on when the Bank of England should tighten policy after more than five years of interest rates at 0.5%. At August's meeting of the Bank's rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), two of the nine members voted for a rise to 0.75%.With the recovery seemingly gaining ground, there had been speculation that more committee members would join them over coming months and that borrowing costs could go up as soon as November. But analysts say this now looks unlikely.James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets, said: "All in all, the data is pointing to a slowing in the rate of economic growth, which plays into the hands of the more dovish members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. It does look as though February is more likely the start point for policy tightening, rather than November."
