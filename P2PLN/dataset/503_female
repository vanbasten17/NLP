When I began writing this blog - almost a year ago - one of the facts about cancer treatment in the UK which shocked me the most, was to discover from readers that there are far too few radiotherapy machines. Cancer patients are having to drive miles - sometimes over 100 miles - a day to find their nearest treatment centre. Worse still - in Wales (and, I am sure, in other parts of the UK) women and men who opt for mastectomies rather than undergoing less invasive surgery are having to travel vast distances for five or six weeks.I wrote then:That was April 2010 - we are in an infinitely worse position now.This year has been designated as the "Year of Radiotherapy" to coincide with the centenery of Marie Curie winning her second Nobel Prize for her work on radium.  She was one of the leading pioneers in the use of radiation as a cancer therapy. Now the treatment is recommended for half of all cancer patients.Professor Tim Maughan from Cancer Research UK said:Exactly! There is little point in offering the new targeted radiotherapy techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy or image-guided radiotherapy - which are more precise methods of delivery with fewer side effects, and less damage to nearby tissue - if there are not enough radiotherapy centres to offer these treatments.Cancer Research UK is carrying out groundbreaking work at their radiobiology unit in Oxford but, without investment, all the research in the world will make not a scrap of difference. Radiotherapy is the "unsung hero" of cancer treatment and Cancer Research UK is calling on the Government to introduce an action plan for vital radiotherapy development. This must include the opening of new centres to serve people living in the vast swathes of the UK who do not have access to local radiotherapy machines and the crucial treatment they offer.Professor Mike Richards - The Cancer Tsar - said:Just in case Professor Richards decides to put radiotherapy on his back burner, we must keep up the pressure on the government.  Let us join Cancer Research UK and add our names to its petition - and become a "Voice for Radiotherapy".Visit http://www.cancercampaigns.org.uk/ourcampaigns/Voice-for-Radiotherapy/
