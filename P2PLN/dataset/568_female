A report today puts to rest our fears of yesterday. It says that Andrew Lansley is about to announce that the money needed for funding any cancer drug that a specialist decides will benefit the patient will now be available in October of this year. (We thought this plan would not come into play until 2011.) This will be an interim scheme before the fund itself begins next April.Macmillan Cancer Support and the Rarer Cancers Foundation have worked tirelessly for this outcome - and today they have succeeded. Andrew Wilson, CEO of the Rarer Cancers Foundation wrote directly to David Cameron and the Prime Minister has listened. No longer will patients be at the mercy of NICE. What will become of this organisation now, I wonder?Interestingly, Mr Lansley plans that, from 2013, drug companies will provide the medication and be paid later - according to how beneficial the drug proves to be for patients. That will definitely mean a financial saving for the NHS.
