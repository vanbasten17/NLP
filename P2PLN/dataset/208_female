A surge in the number of properties up for auction and a slight cooling of clearance rates could tip the balance to bidders this weekend.Sydney is set to host its highest ever number of weekend auctions - more than 900 properties - while Melbourne has 1341 up for grabs.And with auction clearance rates slightly down (at 70.3 per cent in Melbourne and 80.1 per cent in Sydney last weekend, according to APM figures), vendors may be more prepared to come to the party on price."There is no doubt that the increased volume of property on the market is giving buyers more choice," says auctioneer Damien Cooley."Buyers are more in a position now with the increased volume to turn up to auctions and purchase potentially for better value than what they previously would have when there wasn't as much property on the market."Cooley, whose business is scheduled to act as auctioneer at a record-breaking 100-plus Sydney auctions this weekend, says the recent dip in clearance rates probably has more to do with rising vendor expectations than a shrinking number of actual sales, as many passed-in properties do go on to sell post-auction."Vendors' expectations have caught up with the market in many cases," Cooley says. As a result, reserves have edged up and the number of properties selling over reserve has also tapered slightly.Nevertheless, Cooley says the Sydney auction market still has plenty of strength and he's expecting that to continue up until Easter next year, albeit with a break for Christmas.In previous years the market has reached Christmas with plenty of stock still unsold, which is then carried over to following year. However, despite the recent rush from vendors, Cooley doesn't think that will be the case this time around."What we're going to be seeing this year is the vast majority of property transacting before Christmas, which will mean that there will be not much property on the market early in the New Year," says Cooley.The predicted post-Christmas lack of stock should underpin the market early in 2014."We're expecting to see some really good strength in clearance rates and good prices being achieved pre-Easter. And Easter next year is mid-April," says Cooley."In my view,Â  we're going to see good volume and strong clearances in February, March and early April."
