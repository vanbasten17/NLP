On the day that Britain's biggest payday lender Wonga revealed that its profits had been slashed by 53 per cent after a series of scandals, new research was published yesterday that showed payday lenders are not yet playing fair with customers.The study by Citizens Advice said that just one in five people struggling to repay a payday loan have had the interest frozen, and only a quarter thought the lender treated them sympathetically.It means that payday lenders are still dragging their feet about improving their practices, despite the industry's own promises to clean up its act.Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: "Payday lenders are still not sticking to their word to treat people fairly. While things are moving in the right direction, some payday lenders are still falling far short of responsible lending. Customers need to have the full facts at their finger-tips when making decisions about borrowing."Irresponsible behaviour reported included a lack of proper checks to see if people can afford to pay back loans and pressurising borrowers into extending loans.Today marks the end of the grace period lenders were handed by the City watchdog - the Financial Conduct Authority - to get their act together and conform to the new more stringent rules.The fact that many appear to be still some way off behaving as responsible lenders means the regulator needs to get tough. Ms Guy said: "The new rules should contribute towards ridding the market of irresponsible lenders, but this won't be achieved by regulation alone."The FCA needs to use enforcement action to make sure firms flouting the rules are not allowed to operate."I would certainly like to see a heavier crackdown as my patience is wearing thin with rogue operators. They've had plenty of time to change their business practices. They must be closed down if they fail to do so.s.read@independent.co.uk Twitter: @simonnread
