Unprecedented chaos and violence that closed India's Lok Sabha parliamentary proceedings yesterday graphically demonstrates how respect for India's most revered institutions is crumbling as greed and raw politics disrupt the functioning of government and the running of the country.The protests were not even about the political issue being debated - a Bill was being tabled to split the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and create a new state of Telangana. They were primarily about protecting businessmen's investments in Andhra's capital of Hyderabad and elsewhere in the state, where crony capitalism and corruption ran rampant under a former chief minister, Y.S.Rajasekhara Reddy, who was killed in a helicopter crash in 2009. The businessmen who thrived under YSR's rule and did deals with his  son Jagan (now facing corruption charges) originally came from other parts of the state and think they will lose their investments and political clout if Telangana is formed.Among the MPs who were most at fault - using a pepper spray, smashing a glass table top and allegedly brandishing a knife - two have possibly vulnerable investments in the city and elsewhere.The pepper spray was wielded by Lagadapati Rajagopal, (above) founder and chairman of the highly indebted Lanco infrastructure group, which is India's biggest private sector power producer. Venugopal Reddy, who smashed a microphone on a glass table top, heads the Ramky group that benefited under the YSR regime and is involved in the corruption charges.But it is not only these MPs who are at fault. The crisis has been caused by the Congress Party led by Sonia Gandhi, which has gone ahead with the decades-old claim for Telangana - not for any good reason of governance, but because she (almost certainly wrongly) believes it will increase the number of seats her party wins in the coming general election.My book IMPLOSION: India's Tryst with Reality, which is being launched next week in Delhi by Harper Collins India (and is available here), has a chapter headed Scam Andhra. Implosion is defined as inward collapse when internal forces "gradually eat away at institutions, organizational procedures and the functioning of authority that are needed to run a country".Here are extracts from the chapter:"The city has become a symbol of what is wrong with India. It embraces dynastic political ambitions based on personal greed and the lauding of companies that have grown fat on fraudulent land and other deals, literally plundering the state's wealth. The trend first became widely noticed in 2009, when the Hyderabad-based Satyam, India's fourth largest software company, collapsed in a fraud scandal involving local politicians and a prominent business family...."Satyam and its allied infrastructure company, Maytas (Satyam spelt in reverse), were just the tip of a vast iceberg that gradually became exposed after the state's Congress chief minister, Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy (YSR), was killed in a helicopter crash in September 2009. YSR's death, just a few months after being re-elected for a second term, triggered a series of events that led to widespread police inquiries, court cases, and the jailing of businessmen and politicians..."Businessmen involved in the state's companies form a new entrepreneurial community that is significant in the same way as clans such as the Marwaris or the Chettiars....With easily identifiable names like Reddy, Raju and Rao, the Andhra businessmen travelled [across] Andhra, bearing farming wealth from the state's flourishing coastal regions to Hyderabad.....There they worked with politicians, and together grew rich in real estate, land deals and infrastructure projects - and then became involved in politics themselves...."Among the most powerful and vocal anti-Telangana politicians have been Lagadapati Rajagopal, founder of the once rapidly-growing but now heavily-indebted Lanco Infratech infrastructure, power and construction group.....he was one of the financiers of a padayatra in 2003 by YSR that helped to bring him to power.  Rajagopal's development plans in and around Hyderabad could be hit hard if the state is split...."YSR proved himself to be one of India's most skilful regional politicians, seemingly working for the good of the state and the rural poor, while building himself an unassailable Congress power base by providing the Gandhi family with strong loyalty and support. That won him a comfortable re-election victory five months before he was killed, despite reports of widespread corruption and corporate cronyism that had been circulating about him and his son Jagan for some time..."YSR's significance was demonstrated by the huge mass of mourners - from Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh to the rural poor - who gathered to pay their last respects at his funeral....If YSR had lived, it is reasonable to assume that the projects, corruption, kickbacks and funding would still be continuing today, with grateful Congress party leaders in Delhi doting on their loyal and valuable friend..."Sonia Gandhi and her fellow national party leaders appear to have done nothing during YSR's rule to stop the corrupt deals, even though they would have been fully aware of them. There were reports that YSR was 'sending huge sums of money for the Congress in Delhi every month in the name of 'organisational expenses'..."While he was chief minister, YSR moved on from the usual pattern of corruption - politicians and bureaucrats taking bribes in return for favours - and secured the loyalty of his supporters by providing business opportunities for contractors in unregulated, over-priced and scam-ridden irrigation, highways and other projects. The contractors and developers showed their gratitude by taking stakes in companies run by Jagan, mainly in a media business called Sakshi, and politicians and others cronies invested in the development and real estate schemes. Instead of just taking kickbacks, YSR's family and political associates became joint investors and stakeholders with their business contacts."For a longer version of this post with more photographs - and details about John Elliott's new book - go to his blog at http://wp.me/pieST-22H and http://ridingtheelephant.wordpress.com/about
