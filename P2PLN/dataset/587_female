4.37pm: I'll need to draw this blog to a close soon; Helene Mulholland will be filing a story on the rest of today's evidence from the information tribunal, and our politics team will have more on the new amendments to the bill tabled by the government today.A summary of today's news: The health minister Earl Howe has tabled two new amendments to the health and social care bill ahead of debate in the Lords on Tuesday. The concessions would see Monitor, the independent regulator, retain more of its powers over foundation trusts; and place new requirements on trusts' governors to vote on any proposal to raise a hospital's income from private patients by more than 5% (see 3.28pm). The information tribunal hearing the appeal by the Department of Health against a ruling that it must publish two risk registers on the reforms has taken evidence from Una O'Brien, permanent secretary at the DoH, and Lord O'Donnell, former cabinet secretary. Both argued that publication of the registers could inhibit civil servants, who are currently encouraged to discuss possible risks "in a very forthright way", and impede policy-making (see 2.19pm and 3.18pm). The Royal College of Physicians has today written to all of its members to garner their views on the bill, and whether the college should join the increasingly long list of those medical professionals calling for it to be dropped. Results will be in by March 15 (see 12.04pm).And please do take a minute to tell us your own experiences of the NHS - and what the bill might mean to you. The link is here.3.50pm: Earl Howe's letter to peers explaining the new amendments has been published on the Politics Home website here. In it the health minister explains the two areas where the government is offering some concessions, the first on Monitor, the independent regulator:The second is on the private patient income cap - the bill proposes to allow foundation trusts to raise the proportion of their income they can earn from private patients to 49%. Howe writes:The background briefing notes and more details have been posted on the Department of Health website here: I'll be having a look through but do let me know your thoughts below the line on the new concessions and what they amount to.3.28pm: The Press Association has more detail on the new amendments proposed by the government for the bill in the Lords tomorrow. It reports:Ongoing opposition from medical professionals and the Lib Dem grassroots has prompted some concessions, it goes on:3.18pm: Lord (Gus) O' Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, is now up at the information tribunal, reports Helene Mulholland. Speaking against the publication of the risk registers, he says they are not balanced, and overstate poor outcomes. The ability of civil servants to flag problems would be impeded by publication, he says.2.58pm: The question posed by gaeilge below the line asking what exactly is the consequences of the bill would be provoked a few comments, the clearest of which is probably this response from skycamefalling:On the news piece about the changes to the NHS posing greater risk to vulnerable children, there has been some interesting debate about the risks caused by the reforms.From Fatigued:From Gwledig:2.28pm: It's become pretty clear what (many of) the health professionals and others working within the NHS feel about the bill. But we'd like to know more about what our readers, and the public generally, think of the reforms and what their impact might be on you, as patients.We've launched a call this afternoon for people's experiences of the NHS - good or, er, ill - and how concerned (or otherwise) you are about the proposed changes. Do please nip over here to take part.Thank you.2.19pm: Helene Mulholland has sent more from the information tribunal over the publication of the risk registers, which is still hearing from Una O'Brien, the DoH permanent secretary.Helene writes:You can follow Helene's tweets from the tribunal here (@lnmulholland).2.11pm: An interesting statement from the National Association of Primary Care (NAPC) and the NHS Alliance (NHSA) lands in my inbox - interesting not least because these are two of the organisations that have been most vocal in supporting Andrew Lansley's plans for the health service (though they have in recent weeks expressed concerns that the reforms are not what had been promised).The two groups have surveyed the four strategic health authority clusters - London, North of England, Midlands and East, and South of England - about commissioning support for the new GP-led clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), of which the NAPC and NHSA have been staunch promoters.They found that:Dr Charles Alessi, one of the few GPs invited to David Cameron's recent summit on the bill, said:The two organisations appear to be particularly concerned at the numbers of respondents using their local PCT for commissioning support, with their survey showing 20% had opted for this "because they were too busy to explore alternative arrangements" - although 26.7% said they had done so "because relationships with PCT support staff were good".1.42pm: News that the health minister Lord Howe has tabled some amendments ahead of the bill in the Lords tomorrow from our political editor, Patrick Wintour:More details to follow.1.12pm: Tom Clark, one of the Guardian's leader writers, has been looking ahead to the return of the health and social care bill to the Lords this week:The key will be to keep an eye on what amendments are tabled today, Tom adds:12.04pm: Sarah Boseley, our health editor, has filed a story on the latest moves by a royal college on the bill. The full story will be online shortly. Sarah writes:11.53am: Our political reporter Helene Mulholland has just called from Bloomsbury, where she's nipped out of the tribunal hearing to update me on the evidence that's been heard so far. Una O'Brien, permanent secretary at the DoH, has been up this morning, defending the department's decision not to publish the two registers in question: the NHS transition risk register and the NHS strategic risk register.O'Brien insisted that the registers were often revised and the risks were "fluid", reports Helene. The permanent secretary added:She pointed out that the legislation had changed a lot since the publication of the white paper in 2010. And interestingly, reports Helene - and contrary to much opinion elsewhere on this - O'Brien said that legislation was needed to implement all the reforms, including GP commissioning.The chair of the tribunal has said it is not definite that there will be a decision by the end of the two-day hearing tomorrow, and that some evidence might need to be heard in closed session.11.02am: Our political reporter Helene Mulholland is at the information tribunal today. We're expecting to hear from the following witnesses: John Healey MP, formerly Labour's shadow health secretary - he made the original request to see the register under freedom of information rules in November 2010. Lord Gus O'Donnell, the former cabinet secretary. Una O'Brien, permanent secretary of the Department of Health. Prof Chris Ham, chief executive of the Kings Fund. Christopher Graham, the information commissioner.Graham ruled in November 2011 that the DoH should publish the risk register: the ruling is here.The ruling stated:The ruling summarised the DoH argument against publication here:10.02am: Good morning and welcome to the NHS live blog at the start of another crucial week for health secretary Andrew Lansley's reforms bill.Today sees the start of a two-day hearing over the Department of Health's refusal to publish the risk register for its reorganisation of the NHS. You can read more about the background to this here.Tomorrow sees the return of the health and social care bill to the House of Lords, where it is in the report stage; there's more again on Thursday.On Wednesday the TUC has organised a 'Save The NHS' rally in Westminster.At the end of the week, two of the remaining royal colleges not to have yet called on the government to drop the bill meet to discuss their next moves: the Royal College of Surgeons of England on Thursday, and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists the following day.And then on Friday, the Liberal Democrat spring conference kicks off, with activists once again attempting to derail the bill (last year's conference prompted the "pause" in the bill's progress and the government's listening exercise).
