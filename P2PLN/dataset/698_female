When my breast cancer was diagnosed, I listened to the consultant and then the oncologist giving me all sorts of information, plus great lists of side effects - but what I never considered was what would happen to the tumour and tissue removed by the surgeon.I am not sure I even gave it a moment's thought but, if someone had asked me, I would have assumed it was destined for the research laboratory. I would have been wrong.Enough of the tumour would have been used to establish the type of breast cancer but the rest would have been destroyed.Since it was discovered that scientists at some NHS hospitals were retaining or selling human tissue without requesting permission from the parents of the children involved, the Human Tissue Authority was set up in 2005 and has issued strict guidelines to deal with this subject.Quite rightly, in order to use tissue from a cancer patient, a explanation must be given, permission of the patient sought and a signature obtained. This is an expensive undertaking, requiring a dedicated research assistant to speak to the patient at the point of diagnosis and another to wait outside the operating theatre for the tissue when it has been surgically removed. Speed to the laboratory is of the essence.Obviously, a lack of tissue is a major obstacle to research and slows the progress of finding treatments - if not a cure - for the different types of breast cancer.Breast Cancer Campaign realised something needed to be done, listened to researchers and, along with its sponsors - Asda's "Tickled Pink" campaign, which has raised over Â£1 million in 2010 and the charity "Walk the Walk", which has also donated 1 million - has opened the world's first Breast Cancer Tissue Bank.It is located in four different research institutes/hospitals in the UK - The University of Dundee/NHS Tayside Hospital, University of Nottingham, University of Leeds and The Barts Cancer Institute/Queen Mary University of London.I recently spent a fascinating afternoon with Claire and Mia from Breast Cancer Campaign, who took me to The John Vane Science Centre in London - Bart's Research Unit - to meet Professor Louise Jones, who showed me exactly how the Tissue Bank operates and explained her passion for the project.I saw how the donated tissue is analysed - part is frozen in tubes at amazingly low temperatures and the rest is placed into a fixative, cut into wafer-thin slices and laid on tiny glass plates. Looking down the microscope, I was staggered at the ability of Professor Jones and her colleagues to work on these samples - for example, miniscule amounts of chemotherapy drugs can be added to see how the tissue reacts. Re-reading this, I suspect it is probably the worst description of the process but I am not a scientist - as will be patently obvious to those who read this and work in a laboratory!Professor Jones stressed that the Tissue Bank, despite being in four locations, is one national resource and samples can be accessed from any of the locations. This will be particularly beneficial for a researcher who, for example, might be studying a rare form of breast cancer and who probably has only a couple of samples in his or her own laboratory. Now it is possible to collate all the samples on record and have them in one place. In due course, the Tissue Bank will be open to other research institutes.At the moment, it is only possible for breast cancer patients being treated in the four locations of the Tissue Bank to offer their tissue. However, if you are reading this before you have surgery, and would like to donate your tissue, why not ask your surgeon if that would be possible? Donating tissue is entirely voluntary and, whatever your decision, the nature of your treatment will be unaffected. Your details will remain strictly confidential - although, personally, it would not bother me at all if Professor Jones could look through her microscope and say "Ah yes, that is Judith Potts' breast tissue!"This seems a very positive message for the opening of this year's Breast Cancer Awareness Month but the Tissue Bank must not be a short-lived enterprise but, by its very nature, will require millions to keep it going. Breast Cancer Campaign is making a short film about the work of the Tissue Bank, which will be available on its website shortly.
