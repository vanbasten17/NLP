Here's an exclusive stream of Red Bull Music Academy's Fireside Chat show with Seth Troxler, one of the people who inspired me to throw myself in the deep end of house and techno - and to follow the career path I have taken over the last year or so.A descendant of one of the lost civilisations of Oberon (Uranus' outermost moon), Seth Troxler was elected by the mystical powers of the universe to his current status as one of brightest stars in today's house and techno scene. In other words, he's a special kinda guy. A "shamen on the decks" according to one prophetic fan who, in 2008, correctly stated that Seth was "bound for glory" years before he picked up the highly coveted No.1 spot in Resident Advisor's annual DJ polls. Since then, everyone's favourite dreadlocked Visionquest poster boy has crisscrossed the globe in his ayahuasca-powered love vessel,  spreading the house and techno gospel to the masses. Think Benedict XVI in his Popemobile, minus the robes and waving.According to the Mayan instruction booklet that came with him when he arrived, Seth Troxler is one part moustache to two parts Bill Cosby combined with a dash of P-funk, a sprinkling of dust from Venus and topped off with a thick layer of Detroit spirit. To the music lovers out there, he's resident for Circo Loco, one quarter of Visionquest, RA's No.1, or that kid who worked in Melodies  Memories. Loved by many, hated by few, if he's not playing records he's cooking and if he's not cooking, he's eating... you dig?
