Contemplating buying a kit home? They look cheap upfront, but what exactly is involved?Average two-bedroom modular kit home packages start from about $55,000 and traditional pitched-roof, three-bedroom homes are on the market for less than $60,000.But as NSW kit home owner Gary Bullock discovered, such cost is the tip of the iceberg.When Bullock built his kit home in the bushfire-prone Hawkesbury River region on the outskirts of Sydney, it set him back about $500,000, including all finishes such as appliances and furniture.The majority of packages cover the shell of a residence only and do not include internal fittings, foundations, windows or delivery of materials. Floor plan changes and extras such as bushfire protection measures also need to be factored in.Part of Bullock's additional cost came from his decision to outsource the building work - despite being equipped with considerable construction industry experience himself as a retired structural engineer.Although more cost-effective, the option of getting an owner-builder permit and organising the trades along with taking full accountability for the construction didn't appeal to Bullock."If you do your owner-builder on a kit home, like in any build, you take on all the risk ... so you really need full confidence in your ability," Bullock says.The self-funded retiree engaged Hutching Building - a small local builder - to manage the month-long kit construction. That freed Bullock to focus on things like the site's complex engineering requirements, stormwater drainage, windows and the residence's internal fit-out.Adding to the cost was the property's steep and remote bush site and the additional bushfire protection measures needed for the kit home in the Bullock's location of Spencer - an area with an extreme bushfire attack risk.Bullock added steel shutters to the windows, and wrapped the framework and subfloor of the building in a flexible fire-resistant material called TBA Firefly.Making the home bushfire resistant set Bullock back almost $100,000.Despite the additional expense Bullock is happy with the result, describing the building experience as "overwhelming positive".Following in Bullock's footsteps in Spencer is retired businessman and soon to be neighbour, Kelvin Atkinson.Despite only previous home renovation experience, Atkinson is bravely planning to build his two-bedroom kit home as an owner-builder."I liked the idea of having more control over the project ... when it comes to the trades," he says. "I can also control who is selected and who does the work."Although still finalising his budget, Atkinson says any savings made on the project will come at the cost of personal time. The 59-year-old estimates putting together the kit - recently purchased from Oz Kit Homes, will take between 12 and 16 weeks.Veteran builder and owner of RAL Homes, 82-year-old Reiny Loeliger, says the company is built on the philosophy of providing affordable housing that is straight-forward to assemble."(RAL kits are) about cost-effective homes built with very little wastage and are easy to put up and transport," he says.Building a kit home yourself is "a challenge but it's not impossible", Bullock says.At the end of the day, whether you get professional help or assemble a kit yourself comes down to time, money and personal preference but it pays not to underestimate the dedication and skills required to get the job done.
