Research published this month by The Journal of Advanced Nursing, reveals that nurse practitioners are just as likely to diagnose breast abnormalities as  consultant breast surgeons. At the Glamorgan Hospital in Wales, the results of the same nurse practitioner and consultant were compared after thirteen months and it was discovered that the two produced exactly the same results in 92 per cent of cases.The nurse practitioner ordered the same number of mammograms as did the consultant and, interestingly, a single lump thought to be suspicious by the consultant, was diagnosed correctly as a cyst by the nurse practitioner. The surgeon order four extra scans and confirmed a benign lymph node; the nurse order three - and identified a cyst.The 126 patients in this study were all women aged between 20 and 78. Seventy-four of them had some form of abnormality but only nine were confirmed to have breast cancer, which goes to show how many lumps the breast can contain, which turn out to be benign cysts, lymph nodes, papillomas or fribroadenomas - but which cause enormous anxiety to the patient during the waiting time for an appointment.Obviously, this is a small study with only two medical staff involved - the hospital treats about 300 cases of breast cancer each year - but surely, by allowing nurse practitioners to see patients, the waiting lists for consultations could be cut dramatically.Despite the promise that, when patients with suspected breast cancer are referred to a consultant, they will be seen in two weeks, this is not happening. One of the reasons is the European Working Time Directive, which has reduced the junior doctors' working hours - not a bad move on the one hand, as we have all been concerned about diagnoses made and treatment given, while exhausted - but we do not have enough young medics to cope with the ever-growing number of potential patients. Hence, the waiting lists and times lengthen, which means more stress and worry for those who need to see a consultant - and, of course, this also means a longer time before tests, surgery and treatment can begin.If more nurse practitioners could be specially trained, their clinical skills could be used to fill the gap and clinics could see more patients.  Would this not be a logical way to hit the targets on which Government is so keen?The researchers involved in this study are planning to take it to different hospitals and see if the same results are replicated.  I hope they keep us posted.
