The Scottish Police Federation has issued a statement  accusing the media and no campaigners of exaggerating the extent of aggression deployed during the Scottish referendum campaign.Brian Docherty, the chairman of the federation, said in the statement: "The referendum debate has been robust but overwhelmingly good-natured."It was inevitable that the closer we came to 18 September passions would increase but that does not justify the exaggerated rhetoric that is being deployed with increased frequency. Any neutral observer could be led to believe Scotland is on the verge of societal disintegration, yet nothing could be further from the truth."He added: "Scotland's citizens are overwhelmingly law-abiding and tolerant and it is preposterous to imply that by placing a cross in a box our citizens will suddenly abandon the personal virtues and values held dear to them all."Ed Miliband was forced to abandon a walkabout in Edinburgh on Tuesday after being verbally abused by yes supporters in a reflection of tense last-minute campaigning before Thursday's  referendum.The Labour leader was caught in a crush with TV crews and journalists at the St James shopping centre in central Edinburgh. Yes campaigners shouted and hurled abuse at him, calling him a liar and a serial murderer, prompting the politician to say: "I think we've seen in parts of this campaign an ugly side to it from the yes campaign."The verbal abuse and chants aimed at Miliband are the latest in a series of incidents where senior Scottish Labour figures campaigning for a no vote, including Jim Murphy and Gordon Brown, have been targeted by pro-independence protesters.Docherty said people should carefully consider their words, maintain level heads and act with respect."Respect is not demonstrated by suggesting a minority of mindless idiots are representative of anything," he said. "One of the many joys of this campaign has been how it has awakened political awareness across almost every single section of society. The success enjoyed by the many should not be sullied by the actions of the few."
