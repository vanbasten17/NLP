	"The New York Post idiot who failed to make Joan a full page â€” wait until he gets up there! Then watch out!" Norville joked during her tribute.
	The out-of-touch rag opted to give Rivers only a sliver of its front page Friday. Editors granted more real estate to a story on teachers wearing pro-NYPD shirts to school, as well as an NFL bettors guide.
