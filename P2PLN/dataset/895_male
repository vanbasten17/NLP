Here's another video exclusive for my blog, from the one and only Javeon (pronounced like 'raven'). The Bristolian singer has been working on a hell of a lot of interesting music of late, working with several well-known producers and putting together some great tracks. Collaborators include fellow west country musician Julio Bashmore, L-Vis 1990 and Two Inch Punch, a stellar line-up if ever I saw one. Javeon recently gave me this exclusive behind-the-scenes footage taken from the video for his latest track, Lovesong which is due for release later this month. The video itself is Directed by Ben Strebel and has had over a quarter of million views since going online, while Dhillon Shukla is the man behind this behind-the-scenes film.Lovesong by Javeon is out on October 28th.Follow Marcus Barnes' www.hoxton.fm radio show via soundcloud.com/marcus_barnes
