Interesting comments on a DMN Business blog item related to Gasland 2's focus on North Texas. (This sequel to Gasland debuted last night on HBO.) Even if you are new to the topic, you don't have to read far into the comments to understand the passion that both sides feel about this issue.I haven't seen this film (not an HBO subscriber), so I'm including two interesting reports on the film by those who have seen it, this straight-up AP article and this one — which was among the best of everything I read this afternoon — by deputy editorial page editor Matt Zencey, of the Harrisburg Patriot-News/Pennlive. While I can't debate the nitty-gritty of Gasland 2's revelations, I do know that the energy industry has alienated a lot of open-minded folks by attacking critics and not being willing to talk more about compromise. Zencey puts it like this:I'm surprised the gas industry's message isn't more like "Yes, we're not perfect, and we're committed to working with communities, landowners and government agencies to make sure drilling is done right, so everybody can enjoy the benefits of cleaner, cheaper energy and the jobs and revenue it brings."My takeaway from all the buzz out there today about this film's debut: This debate should remind us all about the importance of work going on this month in Dallas City Hall regarding fracking recommendations and how important it is that we pay careful attention. (Here's our editorial on what we'd like to see in guidelines.) It's important that this be a thorough and transparent process — and we come up with rules that take into account all that has been learned in neighboring cities over the last decade.
