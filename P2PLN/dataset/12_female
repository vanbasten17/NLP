Am I the only one who feels beaten down reading so much about arguments among the adults in our local schools rather than a committed partnership to improve things for kids in the classrooms? Politics always seem to capture everyone's attention, probably because conflict has a lot more sizzle than curriculum does.In the spirit of focusing on substance, I want to get this very good education idea  in front of our readership:A teacher with significant experience in classrooms in several U.S. states and abroad recently "confessed to a terrible mistake:" She taught for 15 years before realizing that among the most important things she should have done her first year was to shadow a student for a day.At her principal's suggestion, Alexis Wiggins became a student actually for two days -  shadowing and completing all the work of a 10th grade student on one day and doing the same for a 12th grade student on another day. She then went back and did extensive interviews with a number of students to determine that her experiences were, in fact, the norm.This blog post by Washington Post reporter Valerie Strauss provides both background on the experiment and Wiggins' report on her experiences. Most important? Key takeaways and good specifics on how Wiggins is incorporating what she learned to make some bold changes in her classroom.It's also a reminder that, oftentimes, the most important stuff is the simplest — but that just because the challenge is simple doesn't mean it's easy to correct. You may say, "hey, I knew that already," but do you know how it feels from a student's perspective? And, more important, if we know all this stuff, why haven't more classrooms nationwide changed?Here were Wiggins' top takeaways and solutions, which I have greatly abbreviated. I'd encourage you to read the full explanations from Wiggins.1. Sitting is exhausting. Solutions Wiggins is using every day, even if it means she covers less content:
- Mandatory stretch halfway through the class
- Put a Nerf basketball hoop on the back of my door and encourage kids to play in the first and final minutes of class.
- Build in a hands-on, move-around activity into every single class day.2. High school students send 90 percent of their time listening.
- Offer brief, blitzkrieg-like mini-lessons with engaging, assessment-for-learning-type activities following directly on their heels.
- Set an egg timer every time I get up to talk and all eyes are on me. When the timer goes off, I am done.
- Ask every class to start with students' Essential Questions or just general questions born of confusion from the previous night's reading or the previous class's discussion. I would ask them to come in to class and write them all on the board, and then, as a group, ask them to choose which one we start with and which ones need to be addressed.I love this point from Wiggins related to the solution above: "This is my biggest regret right now - not starting every class this way. I am imagining all the misunderstandings, the engagement, the enthusiasm, the collaborative skills, and the autonomy we missed out on because I didn't begin every class with fifteen or twenty minutes of this."3. Students feel a little bit like a nuisance all day long.
- Dig deep into my personal experience as a parent where I found wells of patience and love I never knew I have, and call upon them more often when dealing with students who have questions.
- I would make my personal goal of "no sarcasm" public and ask the students to hold me accountable for it.
- I would structure every test or formal activity like the IB exams do - a five-minute reading period in which students can ask all their questions but no one can write until the reading period is finished.Wiggins conclusion:I have a lot more respect and empathy for students ...Teachers work hard, but I now think that conscientious students work harder. I worry about the messages we send them as they go to our classes and home to do our assigned work, and my hope is that more teachers who are able will try this shadowing and share their findings with each other and their administrations. This could lead to better "backwards design" from the student experience so that we have more engaged, alert, and balanced students sitting (or standing) in our classes.
