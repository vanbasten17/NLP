There has never been a better time for the  to take hold.As the name suggests, it's all about taking your time to renovate your home, bit by bit, changing and improving it through micro projects.Granted, not everything can be done in miniature form - extensions for example, or knocking down a termite-ridden lean-to that is definitely past its use by date, both call for something bigger.However, for other jobs, there's plenty of good reasons to take it slowly.With house prices continuing to jump around - mostly down or sideways with just a little bit of up - there's a very real danger in some areas of owners finding themselves overcapitalised thanks to big renovations.Even without major works, some home owners are finding falling prices . In major renovations, costs often blow out - take , where the renovation cost $200,000 more than planned.Or , which was $123,000 more than budgeted.The problem with big renos is once you've started there's no real turning back. Yes, costs can blow out on smaller jobs too, and sometimes add up unnoticed, but they won't suddenly run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.Of course, you can be lucky, or just have excellent renovating skills, as highlighted in  on a property in Sydney's inner city suburb of Alexandria.Costs were contained very well considering the work done - to less than $300,000. And the house, which was bought for $740,000, later sold for $1.32 million, so the owners walked away with a profit.There was one catch though - one of the owners was a builder, and the other worked in online sales.It's common for buyers of properties to want to get in and knock down walls before they've even got the keys.  But many times the best thing you can do is move in, live for a while, and see what your perspective is then.Recent stats say we are staying in our homes longer these days - an average of nine years for houses, and 7.7 years for apartments - so that gives us plenty of time to tinker.Living in a home provides a chance to see where the light falls, figure out which rooms suffer on hot and cold days, and to work out if you really do need all that extra room afterall.Perhaps you just need to make better use of the existing space? For ideas on using cabinets and foldaway furniture to do this, .Anyone who has renovated will tell you it can be decision after decision after decision, and often with little time to think about what it means for style, functionality or cost.If it's not the plumber wanting you to choose a tap, the cabinetmaker needs to know the colour of your kitchen cupboards. Approaching a renovation one room at a time over months or even years, gives you some head space to weigh up decisions and at least feel like you've come to a considered conclusion.The key to success in renovating bit by bit is to have an overarching plan so that the work you do in step A really does match up with the improvements completed in step D, and you don't waste money and time having to undo earlier efforts because you forgot to think ahead.Just as you would do with a major renovation, before you pick up a hammer, you should draw up plans of what you want to do for the entire project to form a map for your journey, and go through the usual processes of obtaining any necessary permissions.Once you know where you are headed, time is your friend.
