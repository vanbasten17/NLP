How are you coping with the age of austerity? Are you going without, or cutting back by turning the lights off, or simply being a more savvy shopper?Skipton building society asked people what money-saving measures they have introduced to cope with rising prices and falling wages. It published the results yesterday.The top 50 money-saving measures are listed below but answers included sitting in the dark rather than putting the lights on; moulding old bits of soap together to create a new bar; and only flushing the toilet when absolutely necessary.Frankly these are sensible things that we could all adopt to be a bit more financially frugal. It's not about being tight, but being sensible.An awful lot of money-saving measures also help cut waste and, ultimately, protect the environment. So by helping ourselves, we can help make a better world in the process!Other measures highlighted in the survey included driving at a slower speed, refusing to phone anyone or park in town before 6pm, and re-using tin foil, cling film and wrapping paper.The study also claims to have uncovered the 'modern day rationing' adopted by thrifty Brits in an attempt to save money. It showed that people would now prefer to borrow items from others - such as power tools, lawn mowers and vacuum cleaners - rather than replace ones which have gone wrong.I'm not sure how many of us would be happy doing that, especially with the risk that we could break things and have to stump up for the cost anyway, or even lose the friendship of a neighbour.Anyway, have a look down the list. If you haven't adopted at least 10 of these, it could be time to have another think about how much money you're wasting.TOP 50 MONEY SAVING MEASURES
