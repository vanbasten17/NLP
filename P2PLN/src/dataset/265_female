As space runs out for new developments in our cities, a Sydney project is pointing the way to a future that could increasingly see rundown commercial buildings made over for housing.East, in the built-up suburb of Edgecliff, is now a block of 12 swish apartments, all with north-facing harbour views.But the building is a far cry from its former incarnation as a rundown 34-room motel. Along with marble bathrooms and European appliances, every apartment has parking and storage, and the expansive double-floor penthouse boasts a swimming pool.The development has taken out the Urban Development Institute of Australia NSW Austral Bricks Awards For Excellence.The judges described East as "a fine example of urban renewal" that showed how "highly desirable housing can be developed in busy urban areas through skilled adaptive reuse".The project was one of 14 from NSW and the ACT to win awards at the UDIA's gala dinner on Friday night.On the commercial front, the accolades continue to roll in for 1 Bligh Street in Sydney, which won the Design and Innovation category.Sydney's first 6-Star Green Star-rated high-rise office building draws water from the public sewer and treats it for its bathrooms and cooling systems, saving up to 100,000 litres of water a day.It also has a double skin that makes the most of the views and light while reducing the demand for electricity.1 Bligh Street also has a tri-generation power system that uses rooftop solar panels for cooling and heating.Inside, the 130-metre high atrium is the nation's largest naturally ventilated atrium.UDIA's judges named 1 Bligh as "possibly the most outstanding commercial building constructed in recent years, not only for its environmental achievements but its ground-floor open space and its iconic public art, setting a new standard for all Sydney's office buildings".In the inner west suburb of Camperdown, the Common Ground Model Project at 31 Pyrmont Bridge Road took out the Affordable Development category of the UDIA NSW awards.The project, based on an American model that provides housing for homeless people, has 104 units for low-income people."Homelessness is a particular social issue for Central Sydney," the judges said, noting that the "sensitively designed building" more than matched the architectural quality of surrounding residential developments.The building has a 24-hour concierge to support residents. All apartments have adaptable bathrooms that can be easily modified to become fully accessible for people with disabilities.
