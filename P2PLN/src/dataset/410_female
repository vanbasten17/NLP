Last October - during Breast Cancer Awareness Month - Breast Cancer Campaign invited me to visit the John Vane Science Centre in London (Bart's Hospital's research unit) to meet Professor Louise Jones and learn about the world's first Breast Cancer Tissue Bank, funded by the charity. I had a terrific response to the blog post I wrote subsequently - and I return to the subject today because the Tissue Bank is now open to all research scientists in the UK and Ireland. This is the first step towards Breast Cancer Campaign's aim to make the Tissue Bank a resource for researchers anywhere in the world.At the moment, tissue not required for diagnosis can be donated by breast cancer patients at the first four centres - the University of Dundee/NHS Tayside University of Nottingham/Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Leeds and the Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary, University of London/Barts and the London NHS Trust. Other centres will open in the next few months. Donation is made on an entirely voluntary basis and without affecting the nature of your treatment - whatever decision you make.Although tissue and blood samples are stored with notes on the patient's family and medical history, treatment received for breast cancer and the effectiveness of such treatments, no record is kept of the patient's name. Not that I would be at all concerned if a piece of tissue bore my name - but, I know from people who email me, that this is a concern to some.Professor Alastair Thompson from Dundee University - chairman of the Tissue Bank Management Board - said:
"We hope in the next decade that the Breast Cancer Campaign Tissue Bank will have the same impact as the use of drugs such as tamoxifen, radiotherapy, good quality surgery and chemotherapy in reducing mortality for breast cancer.
We hope that the day will come when everyone diagnosed with the disease is given the opportunity to donate this precious commodity to our Tissue Bank, it is vital to research and vital to a cure".The Bank is funded by Breast Cancer Campaign with the help of money donated by Asda's "Tickled Pink" campaign (£2 million) and "Walk the Walk" (£2 million) but it will require £10 million to keep the Tissue Bank operating for the first five years.Breast Cancer Campaign's websites - www.breastcancercampaign.org and www.breastcancertissuebank.org - carry more information and an explanatory video which features, among others, Professor Louise Jones explaining just how the samples are used.Research scientists will now have easy access to the 2,500 samples of the many different types of breast cancer, currently held by the Tissue Bank. Obviously, time is of the essence and, in the past, it might have taken months to identify the source of a particular type of tissue needed by a researcher. Now scientists can apply for tissue samples "using an online portal with a advanced bioinformatics facility" - which means nothing to me but I am sure will make perfect sense to the researchers involved!If you have recently been diagnosed with breast cancer and are not being treated by one of the collaborating centres - and no one asks you about donating your tissue - please spare a moment to ask your doctor if this would be possible. Interest from patients and doctors alike can only be good for the future of the Tissue Bank - which, of course, needs - not only - tissue but financial donations too.
