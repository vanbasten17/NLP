If asked to describe the symptoms of breast cancer, most people would say "a lump" - and that is what the majority of people, who check themselves, will be hoping not to find.However, there are other symptoms of breast cancer - found in the many and rarer types of the disease - of which people may be unaware.Inflammatory breast cancer is one of those rarer types and one which is difficult to diagnose and to treat. The symptoms often develop suddenly and, because the cancer affects the whole breast, it is always described as being at either Stage 3 or 4 (the numbers determine the size of the tumour).Unlike other forms of breast cancer, it is not always possible to feel a lump. The cancer cells block the lymph vessels in the skin of the breast, which means the disease spreads like a sheet across the whole area. Consequently, the breast becomes red, swollen and warm. Changes give the skin a bruised appearance - ridged, or like the skin of an orange (known as peau d'orange).Other symptoms can include a change in the colour of the areola (the skin round the nipple), an inverted nipple or a discharge from it. Persistent itching, thickening of tissue, a stabbing pain or enlarged lymph nodes under the arm or below the collarbone are other possible symptoms.It is easy for the disease to be mistaken for mastitis (a breast infection) - and a GP will often prescribe a course of antibiotics - but, with inflammatory breast cancer, there is no fever and the symptoms do not respond to the medication. Sometimes, if the patient has undergone surgery or radiotherapy, this might cause a partial blockage of the lymphatic system, resulting in redness, warmth and swelling to the breast - but this is not inflammatory breast cancer.With such a painful breast, it is not always possible to conduct a mammogram on the inflamed breast - and this type of breast cancer does not always show up on a mammogram - but one might be carried out to check the other breast. An ultrasound scan, an MRI scan, blood tests and a biopsy would be used to make the diagnosis, followed by a CT and bone scan to detect any spread of the cancer.Once diagnosed, chemotherapy will be suggested to shrink the tumour, then a mastectomy - or a wide local excision to remove just the tumour - followed by radiotherapy and, possibly hormone therapy (like Tamoxifen) or biological therapy (like Herceptin). This all depends on the analysis of the tumour.Looking at Breast Cancer Care's online forum for people with inflammatory breast cancer, it is easy to see why diagnosis and treatment can be so difficult. There are many variations of symptoms - and descriptions, by members of the Forum, of the different subtypes of the disease show that some people are able to take Tamoxifen or Herceptin, but others have the triple-negative type, with its added complications.There is a ray of hope coming from the University of Texas. In a study - involving 519 women with stage 3 IBC, who had undergone mastectomies and radiotherapy - it has been shown that by combining the drug, Simvastatin (usually used to reduce cholesterol levels) with radiotherapy, there was an improved local recurrence rate.It is thought that any surviving cancer stem cells can develop a resistance to radio- and chemotherapy, but the combination of the two treatments seems to "effectively sensitise the resistant cells".Wendy Woodward - senior author of the report - said "IBC is an aggressive variant of breast cancer with a dismal prognosis - but Simvastatin is a safe, non-toxic drug with a low cost. The next step will be a clinical trial."Meanwhile, if you are concerned that you have any of the symptoms please consult your GP - and do not be put off because you are "too young". Any type of breast cancer is no respecter of age.According to IBC Research, the disease is more common in women who are obese than those of normal weight; in women the average age is 57 (in the USA, it is diagnosed at a younger age in African American women) and, in men, the average age is 66.The rarity of this cancer means that research is tricky - there are not enough men or women with the disease, but the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Foundation has a mission to "assist scientists and researchers in their quest to determine the definitive causes of inflammatory breast cancer - so effective and meaningful detection and diagnosis, prevention and treatment can be pursued and achieved."For more information visit the IBCRF website.
