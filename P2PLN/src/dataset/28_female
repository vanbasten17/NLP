As we recommended in our editorial today, the City Council has promised to take a closer look into the furtive anti-Uber regulations that ended up on this week's consent agenda.  Colleague Mike Hashimoto brings up some important history related to the taxi industry's long-held vise grip on Dallas City Hall. As he likes to say, "Follow the money."What has led me to do the most head-scratching over the Uber story is Acting City Manager A.C. Gonzalez's role. Let's be clear: only two people could have put the anti-Uber regulations into the consent agenda: A.C. Gonzalez and Mike Rawlings. Clearly, Rawlings didn't do it. The Acting City Manager did.Sidestepping the standard operating procedure for significant policy changes, slipping the change — at the last possible minute — onto the consent agenda and then refusing to step forward and answer any questions seems like a really poor way to audition for the city manager's job. We've seen too many of these "move along, nothing to see here" moments out of City Hall in recent months under the previous city manager.The obvious question is why would Gonzalez do this. No one, certainly not me, is implying he is taking any money from Yellow Cab, but it's not unreasonable to think someone has.
