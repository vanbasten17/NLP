Ahead of the huge changes to the welfare system that take effect in April, the Guardian is hosting a series of weekly Twitter chats looking at how the reforms will touch people's lives.In previous weeks, we've talked about the spare bedroom tax, changes todisability benefits, council tax benefit and universalcredit.On Wednesday 27 February from 2pm GMT, we'll be talking about the how the debate around welfare reform is framed. Can a "strivers v skivers" rhetoric do anything other than polarise and distort the issue?Recently Guardian columnist Zoe Williams argued that the "skiver v striver" idea now dominates both the government and opposition's language when talking about benefit reform. She also highlighted the welfare secretary Iain Duncan Smith's talk of 'fraudsters' exascerbating the issue. Duncan Smith wrote in the Telegraph: "Labour's legacy on tax credits tells a sorry story of dependency, wasted taxpayers' money and fraud." Does the focus of much of the media on "scroungers" - Channel 5's series"tackling the Dole kings and queens" is but the latest example - make it difficult to discuss benefit reform sensibly? And is it helpful for those opposed to the government's plans to argue that they represent an attack on the welfare system?How can we talk about changes - and even - cuts to benefits in a different way?We're keen to hear your experiences and stories as part of our weekly chat about the government's benefits changes. Join us on Twitter with @Claire_Phipps by following the hashtag #gdnchat from 2pm GMT and we'll update this post with some of your stories.Join us for next week's chat on Wednesday at 2pm GMT.
