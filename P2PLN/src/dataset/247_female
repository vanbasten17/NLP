How many more children must plunge off second storey - or higher - buildings before action is taken?Yesterday in NSW a two-year-old toddler was reported to have fallen 13 metres from a Sydney unit block after the flyscreen of a third-floor window gave way.The child landed on concrete at the Eastwood unit block.After sustaining serious head injuries, the boy was placed in an induced coma on a ventilator to control his breathing before being taken to the intensive care unit at the Children's Hospital at Westmead with possible internal injuries. He is now in a stable condition.It is a case all too familiar - with an estimated 50 children falling from windows in Australia each year.But it is time that state governments acted to prevent these tragedies.Just like smoke alarms, balcony railings and swimming pool fences, there needs to be adequate measures put in place to protect innocent children from being injured in multi-level buildings. It's all too easy for kids to lean on flyscreens, or to be playing (sometimes on furniture or toys they have dragged near a window themselves) and fall on a flyscreen only to have the flimsy device give way under their weight.But if the window was locked open no more than 12.5 centimetres, or was fitted with reinforcing mesh, the tragedies could be avoided."It is not difficult and it's not expensive and the gains would be profound in the way of almost eliminating this problem," says Danny Cass, the head of trauma at the Children's Hospital at Westmead.  Rules are already in place for new properties. From May, all windows in new homes and apartments that are more than two metres off the ground will need to be either fitted with window locks that stop the window being opened more than 12.5 centimetres, or have reinforced screens.The measures only apply to new buildings but should go further and apply to existing stock.Making the necessary changes would not be a major impost on property owners. When the Australian Building Codes Board introduced the changes into the National Construction Code, it priced window locks from $20 to $70 each, and strong screens from $130 a square metre, putting the average cost of a suitable screen at $130 per window.For new builds, the board estimated that owners and builders would choose to fit 80 per cent of windows with locks, and the remaining 20 with reinforced screens.Cass is concerned about a recent push back from builders about the new laws."There is talk of just making it for bedrooms, not for all habitable rooms," he says."But ... it should be all habitable rooms including the kitchen and the lounge because on our data almost 20 per cent of injuries occurred outside the bedroom."You shouldn't have this deathtrap just lurking in every bedroom and  kitchen and lounge room. The cost of fixing it at the point of  manufacture is very, very low and even retro-fitting is not a big deal." since the 1970s. There, window guards are mandatory in apartments in buildings with three or more units, when children 10 years old or younger live in the apartment.It's not as though state governments in Australia don't know about the problem of kids and flyscreens.In NSW, the president of that state's Australian Medical Association branch, Brian Owler, told Fairfax Media he has been "consistently raising the issue of children falling from balconies and windows with the State Government for some time now".When  it has elicited anti-nanny-state responses, with armchair critics decrying that it is a parent's job to look out for their children, and owners and vendors of properties should not bear the responsibility - and cost - of fitting window locks or reinforcing screens.The same people would probably argue against pool fences and seatbelts.But the fact is that four out of five children who fall from windows are aged under five - an age when they are truly nimble with little understanding of risk. And they are often way too fast for parents to be on their tail every minute around the home.Any parent knows just how quick small children can be, and how unrealistic it is that in a home, they will be watched absolutely every second.In the absence of laws for existing properties, parents should take action themselves."They ought to go and check all their windows, work out which ones  open more than 12.5 centimetres, and then just ... go down to ... any of the hardware stores and there are people there that will sell them a fitting for their windows," says Cass."Take a photo of it, which way it opens, go down and get the equipment, it can be as cheap as $10. And, just take a few minutes to fit it."In the longer term, a broader push is needed to ensure all buildings are safer, and that push needs to come from government.
