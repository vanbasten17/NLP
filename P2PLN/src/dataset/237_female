As the weather begins to cool in much of Australia, some of our most hated house guests - rats and mice - are busy searching for a warmer spot to sleep, and many will find it in a wall cavity, snuggled up in ceiling insulation or curled behind a fridge.In Sydney, pest controller Rodrigo Matamala says he's seen a spike in calls in recent weeks, mostly from people concerned about rats in their rooves.He normally receives calls about rats from May to July, but this year the phone started ringing in March."We've been experiencing about a 300 per cent increase in calls - just for rodents," says Matamala, owner of Easy On Earth Pest Control."They are mammals, just like us, so they're ... looking for shelter."They tend to pee and poo and breed in the same spot, and because the [ceiling] insulation is so thick, a lot of people have really no idea that they have been living with them until the gyprock in the ceiling collapses or the smell is really bad."In Melbourne, Simon Dixon, owner of Exopest, says he's been getting more calls from people seeing mice in their homes."It's the small house mouse we're seeing coming inside," Dixon says."[There's been] no real increase in rats yet, but the mice are normally first in, they feel the cold the most."Good growing conditions for plants over the summer and autumn means there is plenty of food around for rodents, says Dixon."There's ideal breeding conditions," he says.The major challenge with keeping rodents out is they can fit through surprisingly small holes."A mouse can get through a hole the size of a pencil," says Dixon.Rats, explains Matamala, have "very flexible bones" and  - often called roof rats - can squeeze through a finger-width hole.Matamala says the first thing all householders should do is check entry points and seal them up. He prefers a strong mesh (available from hardware stores) to block holes in areas such as the walls and eaves.Chicken wire has traditionally been used to try to thwart rats but Matamala says it is too weak."From my experience a lot of the pest controllers try to push it into a gap but these creatures are quite smart so what we've been finding is that when we do the inspections ... the creature has grabbed the whole mesh and just ripped it apart and put it to the side, and then used the same gap again."Half of their family might be still in the cavity so then they're trying to save them, so they'll go the extra mile to actually remove the mesh if it's not properly screwed to the wall."Matamala says timber is no good for blocking holes as rats can gnaw through it, just as they can with plastic.Dixon says steel wool can be used to block smaller holes."Steel wool is very good, they won't gnaw through that - it's too sharp," he says.If using steel wool, Dixon says it's important to "stuff it in quite hard as rats can pull it aside".Dixon also recommends spray-in expandable foam.Matamala favours using chemical treatments - in the form of rodent baits in tamper proof stations - only when physical barriers fail or entry points can't easily be sealed up.Dixon, however, says it's a good idea for homeowners to strike pre-emptively as we head towards winter. He suggests baiting areas including the ceiling cavity, behind the fridge and under the dishwasher before rodents have a chance to set up home indoors.
