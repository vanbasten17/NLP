In a week where the world - or at least Australia - seemed to go crazy, with jibes about prominent peoples' anatomies, inappropriate questions around gender preference and countless stories of footballers behaving atrociously (proving it's not just middle-aged anglo men who are getting a bit of a bad rap), it's nice to be reminded that, in fact, there's a whole host of decent, kind folk who actually enjoy being pleasant to one another.And that reminder came last night at 7 o'clock when the doorbell rang. Standing there was our neighbour, armed with an innocuous-looking tray. She was a welcome sight, not only because she was a lot less earnest-looking than the local member who turned up a few days ago in election mode, but because she had in her hands a pie. (As opposed to a truckload of political paraphernalia).A spinach pie.And the prime ingredient of that pie came from our front garden, .It was evidence that one good deed (putting private, edible garden in spots where people can pick them) leads to another (today's lunch, delivered to the door).For details on how the garden was planned, please see The proof of whether it works, it seems, is in the pie!One man who has a passion for edible gardening and greening cities and suburbs is Michael Mobbs.The lawyer turned sustainability coach has this week launched an  that could bring edible gardens to the most desolate of places, and, he says, it's generating a fair amount of interest.Mobbs' has designed garden beds he's called . They are a standalone unit that uses corrugated iron garden beds, a 1500-litre rainwater tank, a solar panel, a battery-operated pump (charged by the solar panel) that circulates just enough water overnight, and a worm farm that composts fruit and vegie scraps and drip feeds fertiliser for the plants.It's a pretty neat concept of a garden that almost takes care of itself.The whole setup is about 900mm wide by 6 metres long."It's designed to fit in a car parking space or along a road verge or in the middle of a road as Â a pop-up median strip," explains Mobbs.The garden can be plonked straight onto most surfaces, including dirt, cement and asphalt.The water tanks can either be connected to gutters of nearby buildings to capture rainfall, or refilled from a hose every few months.At $5500 in the eastern states and $6000 in WA (where steel is more expensive), they're potentially not going to appeal to average householders, but Mobbs is getting plenty of calls from government and businesses, and one local council in WA - Fremantle - has recently installed two units."I see councils and schools and carpark owners at supermarkets as the main market," Mobbs says."Also shops in streets with damaging heat from the eastern or western sun that drives away customers - for example cafes - are showing strong interest."As the cost comes down I expect homeowners will be interested too."Wouldn't it be nice if as you walk down the street there were a range of (well-kept) gardens within reach to collect produce? Here's hoping!
