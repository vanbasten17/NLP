Reading Verite Reilly Collins' "After Cancer Newsletter", in which she describes a long discussion she had with a GP who was adamant that the NHS was far better at treating cancer than the rest of Europe - despite the World Health Organisation assessment, which puts the UK firmly at the bottom of its treatment tables - my thoughts turned to how our once great NHS is viewed by other countries. Our doctors may spend a good deal of time at medical conferences all over the world, but I am not sure that enough of them listen to the different approaches - such as complementary therapies prescribed along with regular medication - by their non-UK colleagues. For example, as Verite reminds us, "Europe is way in advance of us when it comes to massage; every European hospital gives it automatically to patients on cancer drugs."I remember sitting in an outpatient clinic, waiting to collect a prescription for a housebound friend, and watching the endless queue of people receiving - literally - bag loads of medication without paying a penny for the privilege. I doubt there was a single suggestion of a complementary therapy in any of those bags. Yet the inclusion of, at least, a suggestion would help many patients cope with the illness and the side effects. Figures suggest that 25 per cent of all patients in England have a long-term condition (that is 15 million people); this 25 per cent accounts for 70 per cent of the total NHS spend (£72 million) and makes up 50 per cent of all GP appointments and 64 per cent of all hospital outpatient appointments.Reports - of uncaring nurses; of never seeing the same doctor; of basic procedures "set in stone" but ignored; of filthy wards; of the rising number of 'never events' (preventable hospital mistakes - like removal of the wrong body part); of cancer waiting lists which are much longer than they should be; of elderly patients discharged in the middle of the night, with barely enough money to pay the taxi; and, from the Royal College of Physicians, a report which says that of the 50 per cent of people who die in hospital, fewer than half are consulted about pain relief in the last 24 hours of life, - are so shocking that, at times, it is hard to read the descriptions of events.There are so many simple ways in which the mainstream hospital or GP work could be supported - not to mention the patients - yet many in the medical profession turn away from the obvious. Why? I have written before about the refusal of hospitals and GPs to offer contact details of support groups to cancer patients; of badly-photocopied, minimal information being handed to newly diagnosed cancer patients to "take home and read"; or of patients having to rely on the staff at Maggie's to explain just what the diagnosis actually means - the doctor having had no time to do the job properly.The Magic Programme created by the Health Foundation charity is dedicated to promoting "person-centred care", building patient awareness and encouraging them to "just ask" - so that people are supported to make informed decisions and to manage their own health and care, to achieve the outcomes they want. The charity - which began with a £540 million endowment from the sale of the PPP Healthcare Group - awards £17 million in grants each year for people working in health care practice and policy to make lasting improvements to health services.This year, the Health Foundation is inviting project teams (from any health or health and social care provider in the UK, whose services are free at the point of delivery), who have an already proven small-scale "health care improvement", to apply for a grant to develop their programme and roll it out to a larger audience. Each winning team on the Scaling Up Improvement programme will receive £500,000 - with a total of £3 million on offer.I hope very much that the winners will be those with practical and not policy-driven programmes - working on the ground with the medical teams and patients, rather than in the overfilled management offices, where far too many fail to understand or imagine life on a hospital ward or in a GP's surgery. Too much NHS money is spent by management on away days, endlessly discussing impractical policies and then inflicting them on the medical staff. As the charity's website states, patients desperately need their health care services to "deliver care responsive to people's individual abilities, preferences, lifestyles and goals" - as they do in the rest of Europe.The NHS was founded originally to treat acute diseases like TB and polio but, with the onset of modern medicine, these have been overtaken by cancer and heart disease, plus - what are now termed "lifestyle" diseases - diabetes 2, obesity and depression. Surgeons perform in the region of 4.6 million operations annually.Do you think that - for all sorts of reasons - our top-heavy NHS has not only lost its way but lost its soul?Entries must be in by noon on 16 June.
