This hasn't been the beginning of a Middle East style jasmine revolution, and Tahrir Square has not come to central Delhi, but protests against corruption that spread across more than a dozen cities in India this week showed how people are tiring of the fraud, extortion and crime-ridden politics that dominate the way the country is run.The protests have mushroomed over four days in support of a hunger strike by a 73-year old publicity-conscious social activist, Kisan Baburao "Anna" Hazare, who wants to wrest control from the government for drafting Lok Pal (ombudsman) anti-corruption legislation that has been talked about sibnce the 1960s.[APRIL 9: Hazare ended his fast this morning after the government gave in to his demands by formally notifying creation of the committee drafting the Lok Pal legislation with co-chairmen and equal representation from civil society and politicians. These events have been widely welcomed though there is concern about the Lok Pal's potentially undemocratic role giving power to unaccountable activists.]The basic problem is that politicians and bureaucrats are not seen as being accountable, and frighteningly few are seen as being "clean".The demonstrators know that corruption goes right to the top of the government and political parties. While no-one accuses prime minister Manmohan Singh of gaining financially from corruption, he has benefited because his acceptance of what is happening in his government means that he remains in his job.Even the Congress Party leadership under Sonia Gandhi, who also heads the governing coalition and appealed earlier today to Hazare to end his fast, is not exempt. Rumours and gossip are gathering momentum behind the scenes about where bribes paid on last the Commonwealth Games and other major scandals finish up in Delhi, and where that money is then invested.In a rare and unexpected example of someone almost admitting guilt, Sharad Pawar, the veteran agriculture minister and leader of the Maharashtra-based Nationalist Congress Party, resigned this week from a committee on the Lok Pal legislation. He had just been named by Hazare as a politician who "is known for possessing large amounts of land in Maharashtra" - a wordy euphemism that neatly encapsulated years of rumours.The flow of corruption stories is seemingly never-ending, as are reports suggesting that the government is trying to shield leading politicians in the telecoms and Commonwealth Games scandals.For several weeks, a series of revelations have shown how unsafe the countries airlines have become because of fraudulent licences given to unqualified pilots. There have been stories about land scams involving Muslim charities and army golf courses, and about Karnataka politicians misusing a student bicycle scheme.The head of India's Central Vigilance Commission - appointed inexplicably by Singh - had to resign from his job last month because of old unresolved corruption allegations. Accusations of insider dealing in the US against Indian-born Rajat Gupta, the former world-wide head of McKinsey who has resigned from several top posts in recent weeks, has added to the image of a society in trouble.The moment was therefore ripe for Hazare's protests, which were well timed because the Congress Party is in the middle of assembly elections in five states where voting could be affected by the publicity.Especially significant has been the involvement of young professionals. The protests came just a few days after young India celebrated the country's cricket World Cup victory until the early hours last Saturday night  and Sunday morning.Those public revels would have been unthinkable for their parents' generation, such is the change that has swept across India in the past 20 years. But what is clear today is that this is not just a generation that parties, it is also a generation that is impatient with the way that the country is run.A few weeks ago, I argued in this blog that the sort of protests that unseated governments in the Middle East could not do the same in India. I said that, while corruption was a potential issue for such protests, millions of people enjoyed the spoils right down through the system to village level, so it arouses condemnation and protest demonstrations, but not potential revolt.The demonstrators have not been out to expel the government, and many will not even really want to change how it operates. But what is significant is the involvement of young professionals, who do not generally share in the gravy train and who are saying that corruption must end.The politicians need to listen, clean up their act and give a lead. The government's concessions tonight show that they are worried, and vulnerable.A longer version of this article with more pictures appears on John Elliott's Riding the Elephant current affairs blog - http://ridingtheelephant.wordpress.com/
