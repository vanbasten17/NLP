The age at which women are invited to begin their 3 yearly breast screening is now 47 and the tests continue until the woman is 73. After this age, no invitations are issued but it is very important to note that screening is still available for those who choose to apply for it - but, of course, they have to know that they still qualify. I wonder - how many women over 73 are informed about the possibility of future mammograms and given details of how to obtain them?A recent report highlighted the fact that far too many women invited for a mammogram did not attend because they were frightened, embarrassed or thought cancer "would not happen to them". If these reasons prevent women from taking up the mammograms on offer, how many will assume that breast cancer will not develop after the age of 73, because that is when screening invitations cease to arrive?Yet it is a fact that the chance of developing breast cancer increases with the years.It appears that the NHS's reluctance to target older women is because there is very little evidence as to how much benefit women over 70 derive from mammograms. Why, I wonder? The NHS Breast Screening Programme has initiated a randomised controlled trial to see if breast screening of women aged 70-73 offers a "mortality benefit" from breast cancer.It seems that older women are having the same fight as their younger compatriots when it comes to breast cancer, screening and treatment. Breakthrough Breast Cancer's Every Chance campaign - launched in Scotland last year - aims to ensure that every woman is given every chance to make an informed choice, every chance to have her treatment based on clinical needs not on her age and every chance to be included in clinical trials. It must be the same for men too.If one of the reasons the NHS is restricting the number of breast screening invitations sent out is cost, then let us hope that the new MARIA scanner - developed by a team at Bristol University - which has been under trial at two hospitals in Bristol since 2008, will take over from current mammography in the predicted 5 years' time.MARIA will be more accurate, particularly for younger women whose breast density makes tumours harder to detect; will have none of the concerns of radiation; will be much less expensive than current mammography machines; and is pain-free. MARIA stands for Multistatic Array Processing for Radiowave Image Acquisition and, as its name suggests, uses scanning signals from radio waves to find "hot spots".Women who are frightened of screening because of discomforture will be reassured to know that MARIA does not require the breast to be squeezed flat between the X-ray plates. The patient lies on her stomach with her breast in a ceramic cup, from which the reading is taken and a 3D image produced. In the last 2 years, the trials have already speeded up the time needed for the test from 2 minutes to 8 seconds.MARIA can be used in any location because there is no radiation involved. Therefore, theoretically, it should be possible to equip a GP's surgery with the technology - thus saving the NHS and the patients time and money - and allowing every woman of any age to be tested safely, far more frequently and the positioning of the body should prove less embarrassing for those who find it a reason not to be tested.MARIA will dispense with the radiation fear factor that current mammograms hold; enable there to be no cut-off point for women over or under a certain age; and perhaps the money saved could be used to ensure that all breast cancer patients can have access to the same surgery, treatment and information - no matter what their age.Meanwhile, Dr Caitlan Palframan from Breakthrough Breast Cancer, while interested in the potential of MARIA, reminds me that current mammography is considered the "gold standard" screening method. However, there are too many screening services who have yet to replace their old equipment with new digital technology. "Make Digital Happen" is Beakthrough's new campaign to remind us that, according to the Cancer Reform Strategies of 2007 and 2011, by the end of 2010, screening services in England should have had at least one digital mammography unit in place.To find out if your local breast screening service has digital technology, visit www.makedigitalhappen.org - and follow the step by step process to see how you can Make Digital Happen in your area.
