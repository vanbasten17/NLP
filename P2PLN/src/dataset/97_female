This Washington Post news article deserves attention for analyzing research that shows a widening gap in life expectancy based on economic inequality. So the health-economics link doesn't surprise you? Now consider that research's implications when we talk about raising the eligibility ages for entitlement programs.As The Post points out, raising the eligibility ages — currently 65 for Medicare and moving toward 67 for full Social Security — would mean fewer benefits for lower-income workers, who typically die younger than those who make more.Consider:"People who are shorter-lived tend to make less, which means that if you raise the retirement age, low-income populations would be subsidizing the lives of higher-income people," said Maya Rockeymoore, president and chief executive of Global Policy Solutions, a public policy consultancy. "Whenever I hear a policymaker say people are living longer as a justification for raising the retirement age, I immediately think they don't understand the research or, worse, they are willfully ignoring what the data say."And this:But given the widening differences in life expectancy for people on opposite ends of the income scale, "that would mean a benefit cut that falls heaviest on people who generally are most reliant on Social Security for their retirement income. It is totally class-based," said Eric Kingson, a Syracuse University professor and co-chair of Social Security Works, a coalition opposed to reducing old-age benefits."I'm not ready to pull my support for raising the eligibility ages, but this article leaves me with questions that I'll want resolved the next time our editorial board discusses entitlement changes.
