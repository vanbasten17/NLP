Hold onto your seatbelts, after a couple of years' reprieve, you could be in for a wild interest rate ride. That's the prediction of BIS Shrapnel senior manager of residential property Angie Zigomanis.It may sound a bit implausible given that swirling around the silver lining of an interest rate cut over the last week, there's been plenty of gloomy news.The Reserve Bank has swiftly changed its tone from upbeat to down. In its most recent Statement on Monetary Policy, the bank repeatedly highlighted that risks to the global economy are "skewed to the downside, with the sovereign debt and banking problems in the Euro area remaining the most prominent risks".If it's interest rate cuts you're after, that should be music to your ears."A follow-up rate cut remains on the radar screen. The question is one of timing," says CommSec chief economist Craig James."If there is more instability in Europe, then another rate cut in December can't be ruled out. But we currently favour the next move to be made in February, after the next inflation figures in late January."Job ads have slid for the sixth time in the past seven months, leading James to predict a jobless rate closer to 5.5 per cent later in 2011 or early in 2012. "A softer job market will keep downward pressure on wages and prices," he says.But assuming the US and the Euro zone economies manage to haul themselves out of their collective trough - and that's a big assumption - we could see rates back on their way up within a couple of years.And given that old rule about what goes up coming down, and vice versa, rate hikes will obviously have to come at some stage - it's just a question of when.Zigomanis says the economy is going through a "transitionary phase"."Twelve months ago, 18 months ago, the economy was being led by Federal Government spending."Most of those projects are winding down now, as well as the after-effects of the first home owners grant expiring, and new housing winding down."The next upswing, Zigomanis argues, will be driven by increasing investment in the mining sector."You've seen some of the projects start, like Gorgon in Western Australia, but a lot of big ones, particularly in Queensland, have just recently gained approval and are just starting now. And it takes some time for them to ramp up and reach full employment stage," says Zigomanis.It may take another 12-18 months for the effects to flow through to the rest of the economy, but when they do, unemployment could begin to tighten again."Considering we're coming from a fairly solid unemployment rate of just over 5 per cent, there's not as much fat in the economy for that employment to get absorbed," says Zigomanis.As unemployment edges down, wages pressure will push the Reserve Bank to become "a lot more vigilant ... in terms of trying to raise interest rates to head off some of those inflationary pressures".It might still be a good couple of years away, but for home owners it highlights one thing - assuming the Australian economy escapes any major knock-on effects from the doom overseas - the most recent interest rate cut, and a potential one still to come, offer a major window of opportunity."Make hay while the sun shines," says Zigomanis. "Put as much into your loan as you can now before they creep up again."
