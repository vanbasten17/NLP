Some household trends should come with a warning. Take upcycling - giving old items a new lease of life in sometimes unexpected ways.It sounds great in theory - and it certainly has excellent green cred - but some things just weren't meant to be.Tin cans as pot plant holders. Shopping trolleys are pushchairs. Colanders as light fittings.It can be a kind of crafters-gone-crazy nightmare.But done well, it can look amazing, in a retro cool kind of way.Take  (shopping trolley wheelchair aside).The Lego keyholder is pretty nifty, and the wrench wall hooks look quite funky. Upcycling is really just grandma's way of being thrifty made trendy again - with no rules about what materials would be proper to reuse.The big positive of upcycling is that it reminds us all to think a little more deeply about what we consume and how. Rather than just throwing an item into the garbage, we could all do well to consider if it could be used in a different manner.In my own house my desk is made from a neighbours' leftover floorboards - but only because I have a brother who is a skilled carpenter.We also have a clothesline constructed from railway sleepers topped with glass electrical insulators - again because a very handy handyman had the knowhow.One sour note about upcycling is the hefty price tags that repurposed goods can sometimes come at. Consumers might rightly question just why an old bottle made into a light costs $100-plus.If you too wonder whether buying upcycled items is worth it -  might answer some questions. Emma Stergoulis, director of Birdcage Design, is an upcycling follower but warns that it can often be more expensive than buying new, even when they are doing the upcycling themselves.She gives the example of a recent commercial client of hers who thought it might be cheaper to respray and recover their restaurant's chairs than buy a new set. Stergoulis was able to source Italian made chairs with five-year warranties for less than doing up the old - and not very attractive - ones.But another client was able to turn an old table she was given from a pub into children's outdoor seating by simply painting it with chalkboard paint at Stergoulis' suggestion."It just depends how handy people are and how confident they feel about doing stuff," says Stergoulis.Painting is easy enough but when it comes to sawing up timber, metals and other materials, Stergoulis often counsels clients to avoid it unless they really have the skills."It could become a little bit dangerous if they really don't know what they are doing," she says.
