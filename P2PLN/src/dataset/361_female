Following my Q and A discussions with Delyth Morgan from Breast Cancer Campaign and Antonia Dean from Breast Cancer Campaign, hosted by Telegraph TV, there is now an article housing all five videos.We answered as many questions as time allowed, but I am sure there were many frustrated viewers who had other topics they would have liked to have raised.Expatintheusa left a comment with three questions. She wrote:I agree totally with Expatintheusa, but I fear the answers to the questions are money and an ignorance, on the part of too many GPs, about the symptoms of breast cancer - as I have written before, it is the first thing we think of and the last in a GP's mind, particularly when his or her budget constrains referrals. As far as the time it takes to find an appointment with a specialist - this is partly postcode lottery and partly due to the fact that we are short of doctors, despite the fact that our medical schools are churning out all types of medical practitioners whilst the government is busy closing hospitals.From Sue on an email came a question for Baroness Delyth Morgan:I asked Breast Cancer Campaign for an answer and the answer was:Expatintheusa also highlighted the fact that patients have often to travel long distances for radio or chemotherapy treatment. Whilst some hospitals do try to help by offering patients low cost hostel or hotel accommodation, there is no way to compensate for missing work or home commitments during the time spent away receiving treatment.Happily, there are two charities who are offering mobile chemotherapy units, thus preventing some of the long journeys.Tenovus Cancer Support works in Wales, taking their converted articulated lorry to two places - a sports' centre car-park in Cwmbran and beside a cinema in Nantgarw. Working with the Velindre NHS Trust, the unit also provides counselling, benefits advice, health education, health checks and social support. The local cancer specialists are fully supportive of Tenovus and have the list of times and places where the mobile unit will be - and book appointments for the patient, in exactly the same way as if it was a hospital cancer unit. For more information or to donate to the charity, log onto Tenovus' website or call their Freephone Cancer Support Line on 0808 808 1010 (8am-8pm, 7 days a week).Hope For Tomorrow has four mobile chemotherapy units and five nurses' support vehicles, operating in Gloucestershire, Somerset, Wiltshire, Hampshire and Dorset. This year is the charity's 10th anniversary year, during which they hope to launch two more units. These units offer chemotherapy only but have the advantage of being small enough to go almost anywhere they are needed, five days a week. For more information on the locations visited or to donate, please log onto Hope For Tomorrow's website or call 01666 505055.For obvious reasons, it is not possible to have mobile radiotherapy units - but we do need more of these scattered around the country, so that people in rural areas - a long way from a town or city - do not have to make the drastic decision to have a mastectomy instead of travelling huge distances for their treatment.If you have any more questions, please email me on judith.potts@telegraph.co.uk and I will do my best to find the answer for you.
