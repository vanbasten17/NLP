India hasn't known quite how to mark the first centenary this week of the founding of its modern capital city, Delhi, by Britain's King George V in 1911. Though many of the country's elite continue to polish their English accents, and relish their links with long-dethroned maharajas and lesser royal families, it is not quite politically correct to celebrate things done by former colonial masters.So, after much debate (while British High Commission diplomats kept their heads well below the parapet), it was eventually decided earlier this year to celebrate the historical "re-emergence" 100 years ago of Delhi as the capital - a sly dig at the British who had earlier moved the capital from Delhi to Calcutta in the late 18th century.Yesterday morning I drove to the north-eastern outskirts of the capital and found 200 or so labourers shifting earth and chipping stone walkways to turn that "re-emergence" into new ornamental gardens (above). They were working at Coronation Park, where statues of King George and other dignitaries were dumped on brick plinths in the 1960s by a government that was unsure what to do with these embarrassing relics of a not-so-distant past - totalitarian regimes such as the Soviet Union and China (plus the US in Iraq) demolish such statues, but the world's largest democracy was more self-consciously caring. (King George had previously stood under a canopy at India Gate on central Delhi's grand Raj Path).King George's statue, and a ceremonial column with a plaque that he unveiled in 1911 to mark his coronation a few months earlier, will be the notable features along with four other remaining British statues. "How does it matter - it's history," says A.G.Krishna Menon, who heads the Delhi branch of INTACH, a conservation organisation that is running the work with Delhi authorities. "It doesn't matter if it was the Moguls or the British. We are interested in conserving history and we can't not do it just because it's King George the Fifth".There have been no celebrations at Coronation Park this week but events in the past few days have included receptions to launch a splendid book, Delhi - Red Fort to Raisina, published by Roli Books, and an associated exhibition. The book includes a wide range of photographs of Â old Shahjahanabad, now known as old Delhi, mostly assembled by J.P.Losty of the British Library with essays by Salman Khurshid, a lawyer and writer who is currently India's law minister, and others.The forsaken Coronation Park location was apt - not only was it largely hidden from view, but it was also the site of three imperial British durbars. The third of these huge celebrations of colonial pomp and power was the one in December 1911 when King George visited the country with his wife Queen Mary to mark his coronation a few months earlier. Addressing some 100,000 spectators of varying grandeur, he announced the new capital that was eventually built in the 1920s and 1930s some 15kms south in what is now New Delhi.While Delhi was growing into a conurbation of approaching 20m people, grass grew around the crumbling imperial monuments, encircled (as I discovered when I last went there a decade or so ago) by a wall and rusty gate with a padlock that a bored attendant would sometimes open to curious (usually British) visitors. Several statues vanished, leaving topless plinths that added to the desolate symbolism. Some of the statues went I am told to welcoming destinations in the UK, Ireland and Australia - Rufus Daniel Isaacs, the 1st Marquis of Reading and a Viceroy of India in the 1920s, now stands in the English town of Reading.Conservators have sometimes tried to renovate Coronation Park. An attempt in 2007 was stopped because it was the 150th anniversary of what the British called the Indian Mutiny but is now seen as the First War of Independence, when the British demolished significant parts of Shahjahanabad near the Red Fort. Eventually Delhi authorities agreed that the park should be renovated and expanded, and that is what is now happening, with the main part due for completion next August.Soon King George V will be able to survey the vast mosaic of modern Delhi from his restored lofty perch, saved by conservationists' sense of the city's history since it became the first capital of Muslim India in 1193.For a longer version of this post, with more pictures, go to John Elliott's Riding the Elephant blog - http://wp.me/pieST-1vN
