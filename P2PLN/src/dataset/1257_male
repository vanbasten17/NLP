While India's politicians squabbled about the perceived rights and wrongs of M.F.Husain's virtual exile from India, the country's most famous and prolific artist was quietly buried in the UK on Friday, and then remembered yesterday at a London teatime memorial meeting - both events attended by relatives, friends and admirers of his work.Namaz-e-Janaza (prayers) took place at a modest Idara-e-Jaaferiya mosque off Tooting Broadway in south London on Friday morning, calmly and serenely, far away from the senseless noise in India.MF, as he was known lay in an open simple coffin on the floor of the Shia mosque, surrounded by nearly 100 mourners - his family, including sons Shamshad, Mustafa and Owais and daughter Raisa, friends and people from the art world. The coffin was then buried at Brookwood Cemetery outside London, which has a dedicated area for Muslims.Yesterday afternoon, at London's Dorchester Hotel, tributes were paid by his son Owais and by friends who included London-based businessmen Lord (Gulam) Noon and Anwar Siddiqi, former tennis player Naresh Kumar, and N. Ram, editor of The Hindu. MF was remembered at the meeting for the vast span of his life through most of the 20th century and into the 21st - from "bullock cart to Bugatti" as one family friend put it (there is a Bugatti Veyron 16.4 in his famous Dubai collection of cars).There has been some doubt about MF's age, with most reports saying he was 95, but his family tells me that he was 97 because he was born in September 1913, and not 1915 as is shown in his passport. According to the Muslim calendar, he was 100 last year.Meanwhile people in India could still not make up their minds whether to honour this great painter or leave him forever exiled their minds. Manmohan Singh, the prime minister, who did little if anything during MF's lifetime to encourage him to return home and defy right-wing Hindu fanatics who were attacking him and his paintings, had the gall to talk about the "national loss" of an "iconic artist....whose genius left a deep imprint on Indian art".Too late, the government offered to facilitate the return of the body. Right-wing political leaders, who had helped to keep him in exile while he was alive, also said controversies should now be forgotten and he should be brought back to India, but more fanatical voices continued to attack him on the internet. Friends of MF tell me that he definitely wanted to return to India - though he acknowledged that his wealth had grown substantially in recent years when news of his exile spread his fame and boosted his prices.His family momentarily thought, just after he died in London last Thursday morning, of taking his body to Mumbai, but then decided to honour his specific wish to be buried wherever he died. How much better to be surrounded by family and genuine well-wishers in London than be flown into controversy in India!But what will India do now about the memory and artistic legacy of this legend? There are three partly completed series of works. There is an Indian history - the Indian civilisation from the Maharabharata to Manmohan Singh as MF described it to me in an interview two years ago. This has been commissioned by Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian-born London-based steel tycoon who was at Brookwood cemetery and at yesterday's tea meeting. There is also a series on the Arab civilisation, commissioned by the ruling family of Qatar where MF took nationality last year, and a history of Indian cinema.Can the India now rise above its feeble responses of recent years and recognise India's most famous modem artist with a museum that will house his work? It welcomed Anish Kapoor, the Anglicised Indian-born artist, with two big exhiitions last year, and Sonia Gandhi, leader of the governing coalition, said she hoped that "we may one day see Anish Kapoor's installation in one of our cities".Rather more urgent than a Kapoor sculpture, surely, is an M.F.Husain Museum in Delhi or Mumbai.June 13: Ideas for a museum are already developing. Mustafa Husain is quoted in the Hindustan Times this morning saying that the family is considering one in Mumbai, as is a local businessman. There are moves in Hyderabad too.___________________________________________________________________A slightly longer version of this article, with more illustrations, is on John Elliott's Riding the Elephant blog - http://ridingtheelephant.wordpress.com/
