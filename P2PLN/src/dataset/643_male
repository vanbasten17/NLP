Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, is expected to be chosen as his party's general election candidate for South Thanet at a selection meeting on Tuesday night.He is up against three other candidates and, although he has said he is "no shoo-in" and that "rank means nothing" in Ukip, his high profile and reputation as a campaigner make it extremely unlikely that members will pick anyone else.The selection is crucial because South Thanet is one of the seats that offers Ukip its best chance of getting an MP elected to parliament. The Conservatives hold the Kent seat, but their MP is standing down and a poll conducted in July showed that Ukip is currently ahead in the constituency.Lord Ashcroft, the Conservative peer who now specialises in election polling, found Ukip on 32% in South Thanet, the Conservatives on 30% and Labour on 27%.At the last election Laura Sandys won the seat for the Tories with a majority of 7,617. But she has decided to stand down, citing family demands as her reason.Farage, who has been an MEP since 1999, will be competing for the South Thanet selection against Elizabeth Jones, a family lawyer; Piers Wauchope, a barrister; and Peter Bucklitch, a fellow of the Institute of Financial Accountants.Â The hustings take place in Ramsgate and start at 7pm.The winner will compete against the Conservative candidate, Craig Mackinlay, who was a Ukip leader in the late 1990s but who defected to the Conservatives in 2005.According to Sky News, South Thanet is one of 12 seats that Ukip will be targeting at the general election.Tory held seats on the list are: Thurrock (92 majority at the 2010 general election), Great Yarmouth (4,276), Forest of Dean (11,064), East Worthing and Shoreham (11,105), Sittingbourne and Sheppey (12,383), Boston and Skegness (12,426), Aylesbury (12,618), North Thanet (13,528).The two Lib Dem seats on the list are: Eastleigh (1,771 majority at the byelection) and Portsmouth South (5,200 majority at the general election).And the one Labour seat on the list is Great Grimsby (714 majority at the 2010 election).Ashcroft has also conducted a recent poll showing Ukip on course to win Thurrock. And the Fabian Society has published research showing that, if people vote in 2015 as they did in the local elections, six Labour seats, including Great Grimsby, would fall to Ukip.But the local elections were held at the same time as the European elections, which Ukip won, and many commentators believe Ukip will find it much harder to do well in 2015 because the election will not be about Europe (one of Ukip's key issues) and because parties that attract a strong protest vote do less well at general election, when voters are choosing a government.
