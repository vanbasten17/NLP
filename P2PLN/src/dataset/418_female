Ovarian Cancer Action campaigns to raise awareness of this disease which is diagnosed in 7000 women in Britain each year. It is often called the "silent" cancer because it can be difficult to diagnose - with no specific symptoms, GPs tend to mistake it for irritable bowel syndrome, sending the woman away and not carrying out any tests. Late diagnosis of any cancer makes treatment options very difficult. Next week I will be writing a blog post about research work being done to find a way of screening women - as is done for breast cancer.If you have been affected by ovarian cancer, you might like to join Ovarian Cancer Action's "Walkathong" this coming Sunday - 1st July, beginning at 8 am. The 10 km walk takes place at The Ashridge Estate, Hertfordshire HP4 1LT and, what makes it different, is that everyone wears specially designed teal knickers over their clothes. Knickers are available on the day - £10 or more if you are feeling flush.Other possibilities are to donate directly or email Caru, order a paid of these fetching knickers, put them on, pose for a picture and post it on the charity's growing Facebook collection. There are pictures of people in Walkathong knickers from all over the world.If you have persistent stomach pain, persistent bloating or increased stomach size, difficulty eating and feeling full quickly, a need to wee more frequently, changes in bowel habits, back pain or extreme fatigue, please consult your GP. It may be nothing to be concerned about but it is always worth a check - and a polite nudge to the GP to carry out a CA125 test and a physical examination.Good luck to the Walkathongers.
