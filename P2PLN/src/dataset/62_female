I'm only half joking when I say that my editorial board colleagues cringe whenever I propose an editorial in which demon alcohol plays a role. I'm not trying to be a modern-day Carrie Nation for Prohibition, "hatchitating" my way through everyone's fun.But there I was again at the Monday and Wednesday staff meetings, this time armed with the latest news articles from the weekend about alcohol + boats = stupidity. (Here's the latest roundup.)My wish list will be unpopular with the Party Cove crowd:1. Require boating licenses before anyone can legally drive a boat or a jet ski. I've driven boats since I was a kid — the water's way more dangerous than the roadways, whether you are sober or drunk.2. Make it illegal to have open containers on boats.See item #1 for why. What's good enough for cars is good enough for boats.3. Wear a life jacket. It's not good enough to have seat belts in our cars — the law says we have to use them. Why is it sufficient to have life jackets stowed under deck on boats?I know plenty of cool people who obey all three of these "regulations" and have a great time on the lake. I just hope more people will try it.
