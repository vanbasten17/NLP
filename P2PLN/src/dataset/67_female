My first thought when I saw this rendering of the Texas Discovery Gardens proposed expansion was "this sure looks like a redo of the Old Mill Inn." And the Old Mill Inn found a way to open at Fair Park, so why not this expansion?No doubt there'll be a big Landmark Commission fight over the merits of allowing non-period-perfect architecture in Fair Park, but I take the side of Dick Davis, the Texas Discovery Gardens' executive director, who writes:"By providing more classroom space, TDG could increase its annual revenues, allowing TDG to remain relevant, a vibrant member of the Fair Park family," he writes. "This building, in its own way, would help attract more visitors to Fair Park as a whole, which is certainly needed."Fingers crossed for a quick compromise that will let this work begin.  Wilonsky is at the hearing so you can expect updates here.Perhaps a better use of the city's energy is this: Love the efforts to get more folks to Fair Park, most recently at last week's Fourth of July fireworks show. But don't forget the part about helping the crowds get out. A group of us sat in parking lot hell for an hour last Thursday because there was no officer directing traffic out of the very busy gate onto Fitzhugh. It was a free-for-all game of bumper cars — and no one was winning. How could there not be adequate police to direct traffic out of crowded lots? There certainly were plenty of folks ready to take our parking money as we drove in.
