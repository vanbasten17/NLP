Over the past few years Hot Natured (AKA Jamie Jones and Lee Foss) have spearheaded what some have called the 'resurgence of house music'. Of course, house has always had a big following, though it was largely underground until quite recently - thanks to Jamie, Lee and their counterparts though, it has been become hugely popular once again with a whole new generation immersing themselves in the music. Last year Jamie Jones earned the coveted title of Number 1 DJ in the world in a poll on respected electronic music website Resident Advisor, while their label Hot Creations remains one of the most popular outlets for house and techno and their recently launched Paradise nights at Ibiza's top underground club DC10 has helped cement their position as one of the scene's leading outfits. Meanwhile, work on their debut album continues, an exciting project that many have already said goes beyond the 'norms' of electronic music to explore other terrains, encompassing the musical histories of both Foss and Jones.  I have an exclusive mix from the twosome recorded live at the RBMA curated stage at this year's Movement Festival in Detroit.
