First come the price rises, and then the exodus.That's what demographer Bernard Salt from KPMG is expecting to see in Sydney as property owners cash in on recent price rises by selling up and moving to a lifestyle location such as the Gold Coast, northern NSW or the Southern Highlands.The effect could also be seen in Melbourne although property prices in the Victorian capital are under pressure from the troubles in the manufacturing sector and a much bigger pipeline of new properties boosting supply.Salt says although there's no evidence yet of dramatic increases in demand in lifestyle locations on the back of last year's stunning 15 per cent rise in median prices in Australia's most expensive city, it's potentially coming."There's a one to two year lag time," says Salt."Sydney was booming in the late 1990s and the Gold Coast didn't really kick until 2001, 2002."People get to feel comfortable, then start to think about their position in life, then say 'you know what I can sell this house in Killara for $2 million, we can buy a unit on the coast for $1.2 million and we can top up our super and live happily ever after.'"Salt says a clear pattern was evident in the last two property booms."You can actually see the demographic flow," says Salt. "Then when property prices slump, migration from Sydney slumps."What it's actually signalling is maybe it's the right time to look at the Gold Coast again. I know it's not a fashionable thought but that's literally the relationship, that peak property prices translate into people competing up the value of property on the Gold Coast as well."Other areas that could benefit from such an outflow include the Southern Highlands, Upper Hunter, Port Stephens and potentially the Central Coast and the NSW south coast down to Batemans Bay.But the "clearest and cleanest connectivity" is around the Gold Coast, says Salt - although not all Sydneysiders will agree with his reasons why.Â "It's culturally very close. It's physically close," says Salt who describes the Gold Coast as the "Australian Florida".Of those who could be cashing in, Salt says they will typically be aged 55 - 70 but also people in their 30s and 40s could look to make the move."People who don't necessarily buy into lifestyle of what they would see as the rat race and want a kinder, gentler more lifestyle-oriented way of living would find it very attractive," Salt says.
