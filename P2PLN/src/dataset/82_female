Who is running City Hall today and can we get them to stay? Just kidding (sorta) but our own Robert Wilonsky brings two good-news headlines â€” the City Council will consider changes Wednesday to what seems to me like cumbersome and expensive garage sales rules AND the Council's Quality of Life Committee is taking real steps to allow more street vendors downtown. Wow, maybe before day's end we'll have retail rented out in Victory Park and bike lanes striped between downtown and White Rock Lake.I love it when Dallas City Hall puts its taxpayers first on quality of life issues. More details and perspective on both of these issues as they develop.
