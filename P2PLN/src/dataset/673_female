We read a great deal about the shock of being diagnosed with breast cancer - or any cancer - but to be told that the cancer has spread must be infinitely worse. It is a time when the patient needs extra special care and support of all kinds but, sadly, that does not seem to be happening in the UK.So worried is Breast Cancer Care about this situation, that the charity is launching the first "Spotlight on Secondary Breast Cancer" Day on Wednesday 13 October. There are over 100,000 people living with secondary breast cancer in the UK. It is considered by many in the medical profession to be incurable and tends to spread to the liver, lungs and bones. However, with the right medication, the cancer can be controlled for months and, sometimes, years - and this is where the right kind of support is imperative, be it social, spiritual or psychological.At the moment it appears that there is not enough information, never mind emotional support offered to patients who find themselves in this predicament. They feel isolated, frightened and abandoned. One lady said that when her GP gave her the news he suggested only that anti-depressants would be a good idea.  Even when she was admitted to hospital for treatment, no one picked up on her state of mind which was, by then, suicidal.Breast Cancer Care's Awareness Day hopes to set out the standards of support and care which patients with secondary cancer are entitled to expect - and the charity hopes to encourage local campaigning on the subject. For more information please visit www.breastcancercare.org.ukFor anyone whose cancer has spread and would like to attend a support group with others in the same position - but I know that not everybody finds group therapy appealing - try Macmillan Cancer Support (www.macmillan.org.uk), The Breast Cancer Haven (www.breastcancerhaven.org.uk) or an Exeter based group called Forcecancer Charity, which offers patient support and research (www.forcecancercharity.co.uk - or call Sarah Delfont on 01392 402707).Breast Cancer Awareness Month is our chance to shine a spotlight on all areas of breast cancer care.
