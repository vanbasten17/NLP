Twelve months ago when I wrote about  from bumpy, weed-ridden patch of half-dead grass into a native groundcover area, there were plenty of interesting responses.From this: "The nature strip is neither yours to mow, trim [nor] play artistic show-off gardener on. There are enough imbecile planted roundabouts and treed and shrubbed median strips that obscure both motorists and pedestrian's view of traffic conditions now without every arty crafty farty going bananas on the nature strip outside their property."To this: "Thanks a lot! Yet more encouragement of so-called gardeners to do their best to make footpaths no-go zones for pedestrians."So, a year down the track it is time for an update on just how that seemingly contentious nature strip has been doing.A year after planting, the groundcovers have spread and now cover about 75 per cent of the nature strip. Another 12 months or less and it should be 100 per cent.The groundcovers, being merely centimetres high, haven't blocked pedestrians, the view of drivers, or interfered with being able to see small toddlers on plastic trikes as some worried readers foretold.Apart from an initial watering in period, the nature strip has not required any additional water.When neighbours' nature strips browned off over the drier summer we have had, ours stayed nice and green.The lawn mower hasn't had to touch the nature strip once. It has required a couple of haircuts around the edges to stop it from spreading over the path, but that has been a 15-minute job with a pair of hand shears.As you can see in the attached picture it is just about due for another light trim.Initially there was a problem with soil washing away as the plants and their roots had not spread enough to hold it all together. But now it can withstand very heavy rains.In fact, as can be seen in the picture, it tends to actually hold on to many of the leaves from the deciduous tree above it, actually keeping them out of the drain and letting them break down in-situ to fertilise the ground.The creeping boobialla has proven to be no more slippery than lawn when planted on the nature strip.It does not grow high enough to interfere with people alighting from their cars.And although it suffered under foot traffic initially as people got out of their cars and stepped on it, it has become thick enough that it can now withstand occasionally being trodden on.It should be noted though, that the strip isn't in a high-traffic area and does have a nice, wide path adjacent so it might only be once a day or less that someone actually walks over it.Despite the concerns of some readers that a humble groundcover planted on a nature strip could lead to the end of the sometimes-manicured-but-more-often-neglected-and-either-dead-or-overgrown-nature-strip world as we know it, everything is still humming along as before. No one has gone really wild and planted eight-metre high native arrays on their verge.About all that has happened is some passers-by have asked what the plants are and commented that they would like to do the same themselves because it sure beats having to drag mower over it every other week.
