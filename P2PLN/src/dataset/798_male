Tax cuts make for pleasing headlines, but politicians' promises seldom end up increasing the pound in your pocket.If David Cameron's proposals announced at the Tory conference yesterday were brought in today, a person earning £50,000 would get an instant extra £2,167 in their pay packet, according to rough calculations made by accountants Blick Rothenburg.That's calculated by putting together the effects of increasing the personal allowance - the amount people can earn before paying tax - from its current £10,000 level to £12,500, allied with raising the 40 per cent tax threshold to £50,000.But of course any changes to the tax regime won't come in tomorrow, or even after the next election. They'll be phased in over the life of the next Parliament which means the new thresholds probably won't be reached until 2020.Even so the effect of the changes should leave millions better off, but by how much is still a puzzle. The Treasury reckons the figure would be around £500. Think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies puts it at nearer £160.For higher-rate taxpayers the figures are even more divergent with the Treasury predicting a £1,313 tax-saving with the IFS calculating it would be £430.Either way, it's presumably good news. Not particularly, reckons Nimesh Shah, partner at Blick Rotherburg.He points out that the basic rate tax band under the Conservative proposal is set at £37,500, which is just £100 higher than it stood at under the last Labour government. In the 2009-10 tax year the basic rate tax band was £37,400.Of course the personal allowance back then was only £6,475, but the net effect was that you'd need to earn £43,875 before having to pay 40 per cent tax.With that threshold having been cut by the Chancellor, in the current tax year you start paying 40 per cent tax at £41,865.So what appears to be a decent headline increase, actually works out to be raising the threshold by £6,125 over a period of 11 years, from 2009 to 2020, which is an increase of £557 a year, hardly inflation-beating.So those that have been sucked into the 40 per cent tax bracket by successive Coalition Budget changes may find that the new proposals don't actually offer them much escape from the higher-rate.
