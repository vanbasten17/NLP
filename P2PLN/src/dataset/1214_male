India  has been in a state of denial for years. It is rightly proud of its  vibrant and chaotic democracy which is on show in the current general  election and has survived and been accepted almost without question  since Independence. But it is in denial because it has not been prepared  to recognize that the vagaries of democracy are providing smokescreens  that obfuscate many of the negative aspects of how the country works.Consequently,  democracy has become an unchallengeable fig leaf covering what is not  achieved. It allows the negative and under-performing aspects of Indian  life to flourish. It blocks change and acts as an excuse for ineffective  government.This helps to explain why India punches below its  weight, failing to achieve what it could and should be doing with the  vast potential of a billion-plus people and abundant natural resources.  It constantly disappoints admirers and validates the views of critics.  Most recently, with declining economic performance, poor governance and  endemic corruption, people have begun to ask, 'Why is India proving such  a failure?'Narendra  Modi's (above) answer to that question is of course to vote for him to  lead the country to growth and glory. Progress, he implies, will  automatically follow.The Gandhis offer repetitive sops and promises, which show that the Congress, and the family, need a time in opposition.Arvind  Kejriwal and his collection of broom-wielding Aam Aadmi volunteers  offer the basic political upheaval that India surely needs if it  is to shake itself free of widespread corruption, crony capitalism, and  poor governance - but that is a long-term play with all the risks  inherent in necessary but unpredictable disruption.Modi does not  have anywhere near all the answers, and in particular will not dig deep  into crony capitalism and political and bureaucratic corruption, though  he will presumably have a "cleaner" cabinet than Sonia Gandhi has  allowed Manmohan Singh to appoint. He will also do more to project an  incorruptible image.After a time, however, Modi too will no doubt  follow the general line and blame democracy for India's shortcomings.  Manmohan Singh has attempted to pass off prime ministerial vacillation  in policy and questionable decision-making as the inevitable result of  the democratic compulsions of coalition government, and has allowed  opposition from other parties to become an excuse for years of policy  delays. A strong prime minister, supported by adept top ministers and a  powerful and persuasive PMO, would do better but coalitions are here to  stay.Democracy  has also provided an excuse and a cover for the gradual criminalization  of politics that has been allowed to grow for decades to such an extent  that election campaigns are distorted, large bribes are paid when  coalitions are being formed, and many members of parliament and state  assemblies have criminal charges pending against them.Democracy  is also a drag on development because, while it has rightly opened the  way for dissent and opposition to changes in land use and environmental  concerns, no effort has been made to curb its misuse by vested interests  who corruptly manipulate not only policies but their implementation.  This has contributed to India becoming an increasingly unpredictable,  unreliable, uncompetitive and difficult place to live and do business.Because  of all that, India has given up trying to compete with China's far  faster economic development, shrugging its metaphorical shoulders and  saying that of course China is ahead, it is not a democracy! The excuse  allows lessons that could be learned about China's administrative  systems, technological abilities and other pluses to be ignored.Democracy  also creates an environment where jugaad fixes are easy, and where the  failures of the system in terms of poor governance and weakened  institutions make the fatalism of chalta hai a welcome safe haven. A  system that relies on an ability to fix things and then assumes that all  will be eventually well whatever is or is not done, surely cannot be a  success.This is not an argument for doing away with democracy,  but to recognize and change the negative way in which it operates.  Democracy has helped to hold India together since Independence,  providing an outlet for people's frustrations and anger, ousting prime  ministers, chief ministers and their governments. Though far from  perfect, it has given the great mass of the electorate the feeling that  they have a say in how the country is run, however faint and rare that  may be, and however much they are cheated and maltreated by those they  elect.It is not democracy that is at fault but a lack of  leadership and a failure to shape clean transparent systems and  procedures that operate effectively without being manipulated and  hijacked by vested interests and those who resist change. That is the  challenge for the next government.This column, which appeared today on the Edit Page of the Times of India Sunday edition , is drawn from the final chapter of John Elliott's new book  "IMPLOSION: India's Tryst with Reality" - hard cover and e-book  Amazon.co.uk http://amzn.to/1pDQzAj
