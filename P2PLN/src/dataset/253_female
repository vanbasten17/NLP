Just how will we be living in 30 years? Will you have a home with smart glass windows and mirrors that tells you what medication you need to take and reminds you how much exercise you should do?And a house that reads your vital signs and tells you when to wake up in the morning? (For many people, that sounds more like a nightmare than a dream).That's the vision of one group who have been pondering the questions of how, fast forward three decades, housing will look in developed countries - particularly for people who will be aged over 50.The panel, brought together by insurer Apia and comprising industry representatives including Guy Luscombe, head of aged design at architectural firm Rice Daubney, says the humble home is about to undergo a rapid transformation.In three decades homes are likely to be smaller, include more flexible multi-use spaces, and will be driven by technology including multiple sensors and moving walls."If you think the technology we have today is impressive, you haven't seen anything yet," says David Skapinker, Apia spokesperson."The future is going to be full of adults that won't be able to remember a time without touch screen phones and tablet computers. You're going to start to see technology like live video streaming and conferencing integrated into windows, tabletops and other surfaces."The panel is also predicting the increased use of common facilities shared with neighbours - and for over 50s that could mean people can stay in their homes for longer."The proportion of over 50s in Australia is growing exponentially, and our homes are going to have to change significantly to help us adapt to the challenges of ageing," says Skapinker.Guy Luscombe says that, today, about 90 per cent of older Australians stay in their own homes until they die. He predicts that at least that proportion of now 20-year-olds will opt to avoid retirement village living.Key predictions for homes in 2042Homes will take instructions from your health care team, delivering live streams and information to help you get the right exercise, food and medication.Properties may be smaller in 2042, but we will use them more efficiently.From solar panels built directly into the roof, to rainwater collection systems and wastewater recycling, homes in the future will be fully environmentally sustainable - and it will just become a normal part of building or renovating a property, predicts Luscombe.When predicting the future, "you look at the fringes and the fringes will become mainstream," he says.Buildings will be more adaptable for people at many different life stages, says Skapinker, who adds that communal facilities will cut down maintenance for individual property owners and increase opportunities for social interaction.
