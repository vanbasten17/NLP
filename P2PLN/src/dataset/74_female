A newsroom colleague and I were just comparing notes on when this endless onslaught of bad news events began. It seems to me that some part of our nation and world has been reeling with major tragedy since the Sandy Hook school shooting way back in December.And whenever bad news strikes, those of us on the sidelines — especially when the sidelines are not that far from the front line of the tragedy — want desperately to help. The result of our good intentions, too often, is an overwhelming outpouring of merchandise, supplies and helping hands in the weeks after a West, a Granbury or a Moore. "Overwhelming," as in too much of everything.But too quickly the "too much" fades as attention turns to the next big Tragedy Headline. As a society, we just move on too quickly.  So perhaps we should all resolve to mark our calendars for four weeks from now to try to determine at that point what Granbury and Cleburne residents need  as they rebuild from their own tornadoes. Or four weeks from now, let's check in again on what West residents could most use to ease their summer. Maybe the best thing we can do for those terrified children in Moore, Okla., is help restock the library of whatever school facility is ready for them in the fall.Just as important as it is for our news teams to stick with these stories (and I'm proud of how the DMN has done just that!), the most helpful thing those of us who want to personally help can do is be available on down the road when the just-get-through-today is replaced by the endless days of long-term recovery.
