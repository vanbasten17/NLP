Today sees the third in our week's Breast Cancer Q and A. Baroness Delyth Morgan, CEO of Breast Cancer Campaign and Antonia Dean, a clinical nurse specialist from Breast Cancer Care again join me in the studio to answer your breast cancer questions. The first session covered the basics of breast cancer; in the second, the panel answered questions about treatment, side effects - like hair loss and lymphodoema - and what support is available after a diagnosis; the third session focuses on the emotional impact of breast cancer on yourself, your relationships, how to tell your children and your family - and how to cope with life after treatment.
