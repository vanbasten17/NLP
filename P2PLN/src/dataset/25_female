Just as our editorial board had hoped would happen, yesterday the Dallas City Council sent the Uber driver-for-hire controversy to the council's Transportation and Trinity River Committee, which should begin considering the issue early next month.Given the uproar from Uber supporters (note the number of comments on the original story), the decision not to vote on the policy wasn't surprising.  What was surprising to our editorial board was that the policy change came to light in the council's consent agenda, as opposed to, say, committee briefings. We detailed those concerns in this Tuesday editorial.Yesterday, I blogged about being mystified by interim City Manager A.C. Gonzalez's decision to put the item on the consent agenda and then to not return our phone calls asking for an explanation of why.So last night Gonzalez called me and today we had two good conversations. He explained that he wasn't trying to trick anyone — that lots of issues wind up on the consent agenda and that last-minute addendum items are common. There's a lot Gonzalez says he can't talk about, given that the matter is now being investigated, but he was adamant that he didn't "slip" this item onto the agenda in hopes it wouldn't be noticed.Gonzalez detailed some legitimate reasons for doing what he did. The two of us will have to agree to disagree on whether putting Uber on the consent agenda was the best move, all things considered. But I do appreciate that Gonzalez, who has his hands more than full this summer, went out of his way to track me down and explain that sneaking things into the council agenda "is not how I do business."So who knows where this story goes from here. I'm certain of this much: There will be more to say about the Uber controversy and about how business gets done at Dallas City Hall.
