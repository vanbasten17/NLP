When we started the weekly Twitter #gdnchat in January, looking at the huge changes to the welfare system that take effect from April, the first topic was the so-called "spare bedroom tax". It had a terrific response, as you can read here. There are now less than four weeks to go until the changes are implemented - cutting housing benefit by 14% for those deemed to have one bedroom spare, or 25% for two - and there has been a flurry of stories protesting the reforms this week: a legal challenge on behalf of 10 disabled and vulnerable children began in the high court on Tuesday  charities have called on foster carers to be exempt and there are fears adoptions could be affected too as the Department for Education's own guidelines say an adopted child having a room of their own is a "relevant factor" in adoption approvals new research showed single parents and disabled people would be most affected by the bedroom tax  the National Housing Federation said a discretionary fund set up the government to support those affected would fall short by as much as Â£100m So let's talk about it again. What will you do when the reduction in housing benefit hits - move or find the extra money from elsewhere? What will that mean for you? Will the changes serve the government's stated aim of freeing up more social housing - and if you're on the waiting list, do you think your chances of finding a home are boosted by this?Join us on Twitter between 2pm and 3pm GMT on Wednesday 6 March to share your views and ask questions.
