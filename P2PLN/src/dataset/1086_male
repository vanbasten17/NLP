Here's a book that earns its place in the Book Design Blog not so much for its own formal design (though that is clear and pleasing enough) but for its contents: it's a book by Stuart Tolley celebrating the 'innovative packing and graphics' of the best of recent collector's editions - not just of books, but of magazines and music.It's something that's been commented on in passing in this blog before. You could say that we are in a golden age for book design (and music design) just now, but much of the great design is happening at the margins, and could, if you were being pessimistic, be seen as books and records going out in a final blaze of glory.Collector's editions aren't a new thing, of course, but Tolley points to Radiohead's £40 boxed edition of their groundbreaking 'straight-to-listener' album In Rainbows as the starting gun for a whole swathe of special editions - to the point, in fact, that the special edition seem to have become  a kind of 'must have' for any self-respecting serious artist.So, while almost all of the design of the 150-odd 'collectable' releases covered in the book are examples of great design as such, they do point, perversely, to the slightly questionable aspects of the whole idea of a collector's edition. After all, who really wants or needs the 'special edition' of Oasis's Dig Out Your Soul LP, coming with two CDs, four vinyl records and a hardback book, however beautifully it's put together. Does that record deserve all that design skill lavished on it? Who is being served - the fan? the serious 'collector'? or the egos of the band members?Put this alongside recent examples in the book from the likes of OMD and Duran Duran, and you've got to ask if having a collector's edition of your new release is truly a sign of creative vibrancy, or just of knowing who your fans are, and what they're likely to want to shell out for.That's being harsh, though. There is some really great stuff in Tolley's book, including people who have been mentioned or covered before on this blog, such as Fuel (for their cover for Cynan Jones's The Dig), and Coralie Bickford-Smith,whose beautiful and influential (too influential?) work for Penguin gets two entries: one for the Clothbound Classics series and, the other for the foil-stamped F Scott Fitzgerald series, both with/under the art direction of Jim Stoddart.Sticking to books, I also really like the ingenious one-of-a-kind artist's book approach from Four Corners to their Familiars Series, changing the format entirely for each artist-designed and -illustrated classic, and, of course, Dutch designer Irma Boom, whose productions have never really made it to the blog, because they never really make it to the shelves of ordinary bookshops. Generally, they're just too expensive and exclusive.One of the other highlights of Tolley's book is the set of four interviews that head up each section - Tolley has divided his survey into boxed sets, multiple editions of the same thing (and series), partly handmade artefacts, and sets that come with exclusive extras. Two of the interviews, particularly, are of interest: first, Stanley Donwood, best known for his work with Radiohead, but whose collaboration with Robert Macfarlane and Dan Richards, Holloway, sits on my desk in front of me as I write; and secondly, Boom, whose work I would love to cover one day in this blog, just as soon as I can afford to buy some of it!These are two hugely inventive and sometimes disruptive designers, and it's a delight to read, for example, about Donwood's work for Radiohead's The King of Limbs, the follow-up to In Rainbows, for which Donwood specifically designed a collector's edition that would degrade over time - that would end up worthless. Or to see Boom's response to the practical problem of a 1,200 page book - she designed a three-part spine that allowed the book to lie open.An even more ephemeral special edition than Donwood's newspaper-wrapped King of Limbs , though not a book, deserves a mention here: Swedish indie pop band Shout Out Loud's Blue Ice, which comes as a record mould and bottle of distilled water. Pour the water into the mould, freeze it, and you make a 7" record actually made of ice, which you can play, for a bit, until it melts.
