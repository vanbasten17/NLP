Get ready to have your household rubbish collected just once a fortnight - that's the message from Australia's peak waste industry body, which says big changes are ahead for the way we deal with the waste created in our homes.As landfill space tightens and amid growing concerns over the methane gas and toxic sludge that buried organic waste can create, the industry has been searching for alternative ways to deal with household rubbish. The emerging trend is to have householders separate their food scraps, including dairy, meat and seafood, into a green organics bin, leaving their general waste bin filled with usually more benign items.When the food waste is put into the organics bin, it means "the smelly nasty stuff with the flies is actually in your green waste bin, so the trend is to collect the garbage every fortnight and to collect the green and food organics every week", says Dr Ron Wainberg, president of the Waste Management Association of Australia."It's a great idea in my view but it has to be done with a lot of consultation with the local community," he says."You're dealing with people and you're talking about people's habits. They've done it that way forever, soÂ  ... they're not going to change that easily. Some people are bloody-minded, they just don't want to do it. Other people will embrace it."Dr Wainberg says the way in which we dispose of food scraps in our homes will change over years not months, though, because the right processing facilities need to be in place first for food to be composted along with garden waste."In Victoria they're building composting facilities, there's a couple going in right now," he says."NSW has just announced with the NSW waste levy review, there's some $400 million available for infrastructure development."Tasmania is looking at it. WA is also considering these things. So it will happen [but] it's going to happen slowly."Dr Wainberg says deep community consultation needs to take place before fortnightly rubbish collection will be widely accepted.While there are examples in Australia where general rubbish is collected every two weeks - such as Shellharbour City Council in NSW - in other areas the issue has created heated debate.In South Australia, a proposal to trial a fortnightly rubbish collection was recently scrapped after residents complained that having their rubbish picked every 14 days could pose health risks and cause the rubbish to smell.The council in question - in the affluent area of Burnside in Adelaide's east - backed down from its attempt to by-pass state government legislation that general waste must be collected weekly. The government in South Australia enacted the restrictive laws three years ago after attempts by another Adelaide council to trial fortnightly waste collection.
