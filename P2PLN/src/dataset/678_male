Greece has made a successful return to the financial markets, raising €3bn (£2.4bn) in its first bond sale in four years.Inside the Greek government, officials are already hailing the bond sale as "more than a triumph."Strong demand has pushed down the yield, or interest rate, on the five-year bonds to just 4.95%, as investors scurry to take part in the debt auction. That's a lower rate of return than expected, which has pleased the Athens government.The sight of a car bomb in Greece overnight did not deter bidders. Bankers in Greece confirmed to our Helena Smith in Athens that the order book hit the €20bn mark on Thursday morning, making it six-times oversubscribed.One finance ministry insider told the Guardian: "To great degree this was all about proving that Greece is on the verge of exiting the crisis and in that we have been more than successful."Deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos told reporters in Athens that the auction was "official, triumphant, tangible confirmation of change" in Greece."We haven't just been spared from bankruptcy and catastrophe, we are once again becoming the Greece that we know," he told reporters gathered outside the prime minister's office."We will regain the quality of life that we had. And all of this has happened with the sacrifices and hard work of the Greek people," he added.Greece had initially been expected to raise around €2bn, before seeing the level of interest in its debt - unthinkable two years ago when the country appeared to be on the brink of leaving the eurozone.The bond sale is an important step for Greece, establishing that it has regained the trust of the markets.As flagged up earlier, some fund managers believe Greece doesn't really merit a yield below 5% - as it is still conducting a painful austerity programme, and may possibly need further debt relief this year.Some seasoned eurozone crisis watchers are alarmed.LNG Capital's Gary Jenkins argues that Greece's debt remains unsustainable, at 180% of GDP, but any restructuring will not occur for many years: "The vast majority of the debt is owed to its European partners and you could argue that the incredibly generous terms of a very low interest rate, a very long maturity (coupled with a holiday repayment which is longer than most loan terms) just reflect the view that the debt still looks unsustainable and that the terms are indicative of a situation that will only be solved at some stage by a further debt restructuring."Any such event though is probably years away and thus the most likely outcome for this new bond issue is that it will be repaid long before the EU/ECB/IMF consider what action to take with their loans."Meanwhile Ireland sold €1bn of 10-year debt as planned on Thursday, bettering the record low yields achieved last month at its first regular auction in four years.Dublin is already fully funded for 2014 and is aiming to raise €8bn this year to complete pre-funding for 2015, over 70% of which it has already collected from the two auctions and a 10-year issue in January.The speedy progress towards that target continued on Thursday when €1bn of the 10-year bond was sold at a yield of 2.917%, lower than last month's 2.967%, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) said on its website.The auction received 2.8 times more bids than needed to complete the auction.March's debt sale, also of the bond maturing in 2024, was the first auction since September 2010, before Ireland was locked out of bond markets and hurtled towards a European Union/International Monetary Fund bailout after a property crash led to a deep recession and austerity. Ireland has been raising debt periodically for over two years through debt swaps and syndicated issues, a strategy that has been copied by Portugal which hopes to follow Ireland out of its bailout next month.
