As many as one in three households in the badly bushfire-affected Blue Mountains area may not have insurance for the contents for their properties and about one in 20 potentially aren't covered for their buildings either.While there are no definitive figures on just what proportion of properties affected by the fires have insurance cover, modelling from the Insurance Council of Australia indicates many could face high financial costs that may take them years to recover from.Insurance Council of Australia statistics show that across the country 3.8 per cent, or about 201,000, of all owner-occupied houses are not insured.However, figures released late last year by Roy Morgan Research estimated the proportion of uninsured households across Australia to be higher. The research house found that the proportion of households with home insurance declined from 92.2 per cent in 2008 to 90.1 per cent in 2012, meaning nearly one in ten Australian home owners may not have insurance for their property.In a statement released late last year, Roy Morgan Research said the decline in household insurance was seen across all household income groups. Even households with an annual income of $100,000-plus are not all insured - more than 6 per cent are without cover, if the estimates are correct.The Roy Morgan results, which were based on a survey of 9000 households and released late last year, noted that householders have become increasingly concerned about insurance costs."Though the majority of household insurance policies are automatically renewed without approaching other insurers, the trend to shop around prior to policy renewal is on the increase. In the 12 months to August 2012, 14 per cent of households approached another company prior to renewal compared to 10 per cent in 2008," Roy Morgan Research noted."This increased trend to compare price before renewal is an indication that policyholders are increasingly price sensitive and as a result, some are deciding not to insure. Â More than half of all policyholders that shop around before renewing do so because of price."Nationally, the Insurance Council of Australia says about 29.2 per cent, or roughly 2.5 million, occupied households have no contents insurance, based on figures from the 2009-10 Australian Bureau of Statistics' Household Expenditure Survey.The council's spokesman Campbell Fuller says the Blue Mountains area has a high proportion of renters and "a lot of them don't really see that their assets are worth insuring".About 900 insurance claims have already been lodged as a result of the east coast fires, covering residences, businesses and vehicles. The insurance bill is already estimated to be about $100 million with more to come."We're still seeing exactly what the damage will be," Fuller says.Households who are not insured are being helped by not-for-profit groups including the Salvation Army. In a statement, the Salvation Army said it was seeking cash donations rather than goods, and had already raised $1.2 million to help residents and communities in bushfire affected areas.Donations can be made to the Salvos Bushfire Appeal by calling 13 SALVOS (13 72 58) or going to the website, salvos.org.au.
