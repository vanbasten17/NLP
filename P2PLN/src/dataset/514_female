Breast Cancer Care has been campaigning tirelessly to raise the profile of people who have secondary breast cancer.  Up to now, there is no data and very little information about the numbers of people whose cancer has spread - usually to the liver, lungs and bones. I wrote about the launch of "Secondary Breast Cancer" day, on October 13 last year and am now delighted to discover that day was just a beginning.The Government - in its new Cancer Strategy-  has made a commitment to collect the data needed and to ensure patients are given the support they deserve.  With the correct medication, it is possible for patients to live for months - or years - and have a good quality of life but, as Breast Cancer Care recognizes, the support must be constant and holistic.The government has promised Â£750 million over the next four years to ensure cancer patients receive earlier diagnoses, through more screening for more people, and that the NHS cancer departments become more patient centred. The government has listened to Breast Cancer Care - about time. Jane Hatfield, Director of Policy and Research at Breast Cancer Care, speaks for all of us.On hearing of the government's decision, she said: "Finding out the number of people diagnosed with secondary breast cancer is the vital first step to providing the care and support that they deserve and desperately need. So we're extremely pleased with this announcement - it is recognition that guessing is no longer good enough."Until now people with secondary breast cancer have been largely overlooked in the planning of NHS services, leaving them isolated and unsupported in the face of this incurable disease. We'll continue to work with people with secondary breast cancer to ensure that this commitment produces tangible improvements for them and we'll support the DH in developing their plan."She finished by saying: "Sadly some of the women who have inspired and participated in our campaign over several years are no longer with us to see this success - it's a fitting tribute to their drive and determination that their needs are now being recognised."If you, your friend or a member of your family needs support, please contact breastcancercare.org.uk.
