It was good while it lasted - all that warm weather.But now that the night-time temperatures in most parts of Australia are starting to slip into something a little less comfortable - single digits - it's time to get ready for winter.Here are six tips for keeping warm and toasty during the cooler months.While shady plants near to windows offer fantastic protection in summer, especially on the northern and western faces of your property, they're not so great for winter.To maximise the sun getting into your windows on the east, north and west, consider pruning back any plants that block sunlight.Thinning foliage on the southern side won't allow in any extra sun but it could help to increase light levels in darker rooms.How many times do you drive past homes on sunny winters days and see them all closed up? Plenty, I bet!It sounds basic, but remembering to open up blinds and curtains on northern windows on sunnier winter days really can help to warm up your home.If you've got west-facing windows now is the time to love them and unshackle them from heavy coverings on sunny afternoons when all that western sun will actually be welcome.Single pane windows are fantastic conductors of heat and, left uncovered at night, spend the evening transferring your home's warmth out into the cool air - which is not so fantastic.Whether it's with thick curtains with pelmets overhead that stop the air circulating, or more minamalist honeycomb blinds, you'll need to dress your windows for winter.Pelmets aren't exactly all the rage these days and honeycomb blinds can look a little too "office", so a good option could be a honeycomb or a thick, snug-fitting roman blind layered with a softer-looking curtain.Many people think ceiling fans are just for hot weather, but most are great for winter, too. (That is, if they have a winter switch.)Putting them in winter mode makes them run backwards. Set them on their lowest speed and they will direct the warm air from across the ceilings, and down the walls.This will help you - surprisingly - to feel a couple of degrees warmer and can also help to combat condensation problems on windows by drying them out.It's one of the cheapest things you can do to cut down your heating bill - draught-proofing your house.Most hardware stores will have an array of door and window seals on offer for you to use.Do consider also draught-sealing doors to rooms that you don't use a great deal and are happy to keep closed off and unheated.For most people 22 degrees is a comfortable temperature to have your home at, some people can manage at 18-21 degrees.It's worth keeping the temp down somewhat as it is estimated that every degree warmer you heat your home adds about 10 per cent to the cost of your heating bill.
