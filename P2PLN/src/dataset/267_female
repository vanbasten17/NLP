Like many 1980s extensions, the upper floor of this Sydney home was poorly insulated, badly ventilated, and, unsurprisingly, subject to temperature extremes.But a major overhaul has changed all of that. Now, a skillion roof tips up to the north and high-set fixed and louvre windows flood the upper floor of the property with winter sunlight, and cooling summer breezes.The high-set windows were a good solution, says builder Darryn Parkinson of your abode, to the problem of not interfering with neighbours' privacy in the built-up area.The house, in the beachside suburb of Clovelly, recently won your abode an award for GreenSmart Renovation/Addition Project.The home's old roof was flat with pop-up skylight windows facing south. "The house was very dark and very cold, and so it just didn't work," says Parkinson.Insulation levels in the ceiling and walls are now above the minimum requirements, and during summer peaks of 35 degrees, the home maintains 25-27 degrees, relying solely on natural ventilation.During the cooler months, the sun entering through the high-set windows has helped the home stay between 21-22 without any extra heating - although in the lower level of the property, where the bedrooms are, the original double brick cottage receives no sunlight and requires extra heating in the morning and late in the evening.This is supplied by a gas-powered hydronic heating system (operated separately to the gas hot water for the home), with radiator panels fixed to the walls."It's just basically hot water pipework fed under the floor and popping up in rooms with radiators," says Parkinson."That type of heating is quite good in a retrofit because it's not very destructive. As long as you can get access to either an external wall or an underfloor space, then you can fit the heating in the rooms, as long as there is wall space to put a radiator."You can quite easily provide good quality and economical heating to a space."The main items selected for this home's system were aÂ  BAXI boiler and ThermaRad radiators."A radiator installation will typically cost around $1500 per radiator," says Parkinson. "In this case there was five radiators and the install cost was around $8000."The upper floor, where the living areas are, requires no artificial heating.During the renovation, which only involved gutting the upper shell and adding the new roof, not extending, there was a particular focus on recycling materials from the old home, and 60-70 per cent of items were recycled.A hardwood pergola was re-machined and reused as internal exposed beams, which were bolted together so they could easily be taken apart if, years down the track, further building works or demolition are done.The old windows, having been replaced with low-emissivity glass to improve the thermal performance, were sent off for recycling, as was the previous metal roof.Recycled Tallowood and Blackbutt hardwood were used extensively inside and out.Cabinets were made from E0 low-formaldehyde MDF boards and E0 plywood. (MDF producer Laminex says "E1 represents the maximum level recommended by various authorities, E0 MDF boards have just half the formaldehyde of E1 MDF.")Many of the former kitchen's appliances were reused, and the toilet pan and cistern were, after changing some internal components, also reemployed. Handrails and toilet roll holders were also reinstated.Many homeowners are not keen on reusing such items, Parkinson says, although he often pushes them to: "You might get another five to 10 years out of it. Why would you just fling it?"Green "bling" items included a 1.5 kilowatt solar power system, which won't cover the home's entire electricity use but will make a big dent, and an  energy monitoring system, letting the home owners know, real-time, how much power their panels are producing, and how much energy the home is using.Inside the home, the paint used was Murobond's no-VOC (volatile organic compounds) . It is made from natural products including milk, egg white, vinegar and linseed oil.Water based low-VOC clear finishes were used for all of the hardwoods.During the build, the scaffolding was covered in shade cloth to help contain the dust.Other green elements of the home included two 2000-litre rainwater tanks plumbed to the toilets and laundry. Given their smaller size, they have had quite a big impact - helping to cut the home's water use by 40 per cent.Contributing too, have been the water-efficient fixtures and appliances, which are 4 to 6 star  The highest rating available is 6 stars.The renovation cost $3500 a square metre - all up about $500,000. Adding to the cost was the narrow block, typical of Sydney's beachside areas, which made it troublesome to move materials in and out, and meant many of the elements were fabricated offsite.
