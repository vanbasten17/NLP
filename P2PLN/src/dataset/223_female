Homeowners have been handed a unique opportunity to pay down their mortgages as standard variable rates fall to near-record lows on the back of the lowest official interest rates since at least 1959.If passed on in full by the major lenders, this week's historic interest rate cut to 2.5 per cent will take actual standard variable home loan rates to about 5.39 per cent, a mere notch above the 5.38 per cent rate Before this week's Reserve Bank cut, the advertised standard variable rate was about 6.2 per cent. However, thanks to discounts of up to 1 per cent being offered by lenders, the actual rate paid by borrowers on outstanding loans has been about 5.64 per cent, according to financial comparison website RateCity. This week's interest rate cut could take actual standard variable rates to levels not seen since the 1960s.From 1959 - 1970 standard variable rates hovered between 5 per cent and 5.88 per cent.Standard variable rates then trended up through the '70s and '80s, peaking at an horrendous 17 per cent in 1990.The lowest standard variable rates got to after that was 5.75 per cent during the financial crisis, in April and May 2009.This week's rate cut presents mortgage holders with a chance to slice a large chunk off their mortgage by maintaining their current repayment levels. If passed on in full, today's rate cut will slash about $46 from the monthly repayments of an average $300,000 mortgage - or more than $550 a year.Official interest rates have fallen by 2.25 per cent since October 2011, when they were at 4.75 per cent.While the Reserve Bank and sectors including retail and property will hope that consumers will use the low rates to upgrade their homes, renovate or simply go shopping, Australia's new-found love of saving and paying down debt has, so far, remained unbroken.Householders are now saving more than 10 per cent of their income - a vast difference to where we were a decade ago, as shown in this RBA chart.  One option open to savvy householders is to also cash in on the increased competition among lenders.Alex Parsons, chief executive of RateCity, says the gap between the variable interest rates on offer from lenders has blown out to 2.01 percentage points.Before this week's rate cut, standard variable rates on offer from lenders ranged from 4.74 per cent to 6.75 per cent. Twelve months ago the rate spread was 1.78 percentage points, and two years ago it was 1.71 percentage points, Parsons says."For a borrower with a $300,000 home loan repaid over 25 years, this gap represents a difference of $349 in monthly repayments and more than $4100 in the first year," Parsons says.
