The auction market faces a post election test this weekend with 633 properties scheduled to go under the hammer in Sydney and 841 in Melbourne.It will be the second-biggest auction day of the year so far, after Super Saturday in March.Dr Andrew Wilson, the senior economist at Australian Property Monitors (a Fairfax Media company), says it's a precursor of things to come and auction numbers could climb further over the coming weeks as more vendors are coaxed out by the recent high clearance rates.Wilson says there's no reason that auction clearance rates won't be similarly high this weekend, despite the increased number of properties on offer."Higher numbers are always a test for an auction market," he says."But one of the misconceptions has been that the reason we've had higher clearance rates is that we've had low listing numbers. Well that's not correct. We've actually had significantly higher listing numbers this year than last year. And all the tests that the market has faced, in having to absorb increased listings, the market has passed."Although the top of the market remains flat, investors are active and, in Sydney in particular, "the thirst for property seems to be unquenchable", says Wilson.The election may have resulted in a new government but Wilson is not anticipating that will have much impact on the property market."[The election has] generally been a ho-hum distraction for the market," he says."The housing markets have focused on those lowest interest rates in 50 years and investors are looking at house price rises to generate capital growth, so what's happening in the political arena is just really a non-event in terms of what's happening in the housing market."There's really no indication of significant policy changes that would impact the macro economy in the short term ... that would affect things like interest rates or the unemployment rate, which are key drivers of the market."There are bigger forces at work at the moment and confidence is the biggest force."Â
