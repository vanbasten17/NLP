It's only been around 15 months since I really started to immerse myself in house and techno music - funnily enough, my love of the music has grown almost in sync with the whole scene seeing a massive resurgence. Over the past 12 months there have been many, many high quality releases and dancefloor destroyers. Throughout 2011 I've been to club nights, warehouse parties and festivals - as well as hung out with like-minded music lovers and interviewed top DJs and producers, all of which has fed into the list I've compiled below. I've put together a list of the tracks that really stood out for me... the ones that got played time and again everywhere I went, the ones that had me and my mates going crazy and dancing like maniacs and the ones that really left a lasting impression... all just my opinion of course, so I'm sure many would disagree with me. There are so many other tunes that could have gone on the list, so it's in no way definitive... I have no doubt that I've missed out some stunners, but I had to be selective. For example both Benoit  Sergio and Maceo Plex have produced way more than just one superlative track this year, but listing all of them would have looked silly. So, anyway, here they are.WhoMadeWho - Every Minute Alone (Tale Of Us remix) [Life Death]Benoit Sergio - Everybody [DFA Records]Tanner Ross - B-Side [No.19] M A N I K - She Watches Me [Culprit]Maya Jane Coles - Parallel Worlds [Hypercolour]Laura Jones - Love In Me [Leftroom]
