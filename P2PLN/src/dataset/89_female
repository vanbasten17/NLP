I got the news at lunch today and am just now getting a chance to make sense of it. So for now, I'll refer you to Scott Henson's Grits for Breakfast analysis of the decision. As Grits notes, the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeals made this decision so quickly and the lack of dissent on the bench are strong and positive signals for Edward Graf (who is the man on the left in this 1988 trial photo).For those of you who don't remember the Graf case, I last wrote about it here and here. Additionally, our newspaper editorialized on the case here.There have been indications from the McLennan County DA's office that it does not intend to re-try the case. But Edward's ex-wife, who still believes he is guilty, is pushing to get a retrial. While I can't imagine her pain at having lost two sons, I would hope that anyone who hears the statements she continues to make would at least read a full and objective report of the deaths. For example, this complete roundup from the Waco Tribune Herald's Cindy Culp.While the Criminal Appeals ruling is a big deal for the Graf family, it's also a big win for those who have fought so hard, as we wrote in our editorial on the topic, to guarantee a "systematic re-examination of the science in arson convictions that is unprecedented in the nation."In Graf's case, five fire science experts who reviewed the case anew, including one hired by the McLennan County DA's office, found there is no evidence proving the blaze was intentionally set. And, as the Tribune Herald article notes, they questioned other parts of the prosecution's story as well.Clare Bradburn lost Jason and Joby in that 1986 fire. But let's not forget that Edward lost those two boys too — plus a whole lot more.
