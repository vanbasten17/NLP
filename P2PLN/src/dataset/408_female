Since my blog post about the Stage 3 trial of CVac - a new treatment for ovarian cancer - I have been in contact with Dr Neil Frazer, who is heading this research for the Australian company Prima Biomed. He has answered my questions about the treatment, clarified the methodology and explained about Prima Biodmed's medical facility in Dubai where CVac will be supplied.CVac is a process which uses the patient's own T-cells to stimulate the immune system to launch an attack on the ovarian cancer cells.Dr Frazer told me:This treatment is repeated 3 times, at 4 week intervals, after which there are 9 more injections on a monthly basis - which adds up to the best part of a year. Unfortunately there are no trials of CVac taking place in the UK - Dr Frazer is in North Carolina - but Prima Biomed are working with The City Hospital in Dubai under the leadership of Dr Fadi Mikhael, an oncologist who trained in the USA. The facility will open shortly and I asked Dr Frazer whether a patient - not from the United Arab Emirates but who might want to take part in the trial - would have to stay in Dubai for the year, or would it be possible to bring the CVac back to her own country for administration by her own doctor. Dr Frazer's answer was that they are working out the best way of shipping the CVac (which can be stored for up to 2 years in liquid nitrogen) although Dr Mikhael would need to see the patient at regular intervals to review the cancer.My last question to Dr Frazer was whether he could see CVac taking the place of chemotherapy, which at the moment is considered as a maintenance treatment.His answer was:Mucin-1 is found on other cancerous tumours - lung, colon and breast - so, if CVac works safely and effectively for ovarian cancer, perhaps there is a chance that the treatment might be used for other cancers.Obviously, multiple trips to Dubai are out of the question for most people but Dr Sadaf Ghaem-Maghami at the Ovarian Cancer Action Research Centre in the UK said: "There are plans early next year to roll out phases 1 and 2 of clinical trials based on work already carried out on immunotherapy at Imperial College." This is closer to home and should arouse interest from UK oncologists.Dr Frazer feels strongly that, as a physician, the one thing which gives him enormous comfort is that by using a patient's own immune cells, the likelihood of causing any harm is considerably diminished. The product has been very well tolerated by recipients to date. He said: "Ovarian Cancer is such a tough disease to treat and safer alternatives to multiple chemotherapies, or prolongation of time between chemotherapies, is a goal our company and others in the field are hoping to achieve."With enthusiastic and dedicated doctors like Scottish-born Dr Neil Frazer, there is a good chance this goal will be achieved. Just a pity the UK has to wait until 2013 for our trial to begin.For information about ovarian cancer please log on to Ovarian Cancer Action - www.ovarian.org.uk - helpline number 0300 456 4700.
