Keven posted an interesting question Tuesday morning regarding the Fed chair sweepstakes. As the week has gone on, more commentators are stepping up to the line of crying sexism in regard to  why the Fed's vice chair, Janet Yellen, hasn't picked up more steam in decision-making over who will succeed Ben Bernanke.Ezra Klein is credited with writing about it first, several weeks ago. I first picked up on it in this Atlantic article. The idea that Yellen doesn't have the "gravitas" to manage a financial crisis is simply a thinly veiled way of saying a woman's not up to the job. As Matthew O'Brien points out in the Atlantic, she was part of the Fed team that handled the last financial crisis. Paul Krugman devoted his column this morning to the same "gravitas" BS.Based on what I've read since Keven first posted her POV, Yellen seems a strong choice. And if she's not the best choice, I'd like to hear some reasons that don't include code words like "gravitas." As Krugman writes:So is Janet Yellen the only possible candidate to be the next leader of the Fed? Of course not. But the case for someone else should be made on the merits — and, so far, that hasn't been what's happening.Follow @SharonFGrigsby
