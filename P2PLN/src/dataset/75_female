Several items I wanted to make sure to highlight before more time passes:I continue to believe that Mayor Rawlings' GrowSouth initiative (which we last editorialized about here) is making a genuine difference in the battle to close the gap between the northern and southern portions of our city. For those of you who were not on hand for the mayor's year two kickoff last month — and, more important, for those of you who may not have seen first-hand the changes that are coming to what we called "The Invisible Dallas" back in the early days of our "Bridging the Gap" project, take time to watch all four of the videos from the GrowSouth event, which were just released last week.Another strong look into southern Dallas neighborhoods came in the DMN Points section Sunday — a package that included an ambitious idea about creating a "turnaround zone" for the Lincoln High School attendance area, an editorial challenging philanthropists in Dallas to put big money into helping the Lincoln area and a QA with Mike Miles regarding his academic plans for the area.I'm very interested in hearing from readers about your reaction to our ideas for how to transform the quality of life for those living in the Lincoln attendance zone. In my mind, the first step is for someone to step up and own the creation of a team from South Dallas and the rest of the city charged with coming up with this holistic Harlem Children's Zone-like idea. Who is the person to lead that charge?Finally, a little icing on the cake — this is more good news for the I-20 corridor, which passes through both southern Dallas proper and southern Dallas County suburbs. DMN real estate editor says "with additional buildings now in the works, southern Dallas County is one of the hottest industrial markets in the country." It's great to see companies responding to pitches like ours that southern Dallas is a little-tapped reservoir of job-seekers and available land.
