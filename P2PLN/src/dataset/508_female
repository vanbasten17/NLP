Arriving home from holiday yesterday, I found - among the mountain of mail - a letter from the NHS Breast Screening Programme in my region, with a confidential questionnaire to be completed and brought to the appointment.My first thought was - why am I receiving an invitation for breast screening at all, given that I am two years on from breast cancer and being checked regularly by an oncologist and a breast consultant?On ringing the given telephone number, a charming lady - who had clearly taken many such calls - answered my question with a sigh and explained that the only way the West of London Breast Screening Service would know my situation would be if my GP had remembered to pass on the information. Obviously, my GP had not done so - and, it appears, too few make the necessary contact.Why had my GP not made the call, emailed the information or, even, written a letter about it? Can the process of passing on the information from GP to Breast Screening Service be so complicated? Forwarding such information would be of enormous help to the patient - who might be someone already diagnosed with breast cancer, at a sensitive or difficult stage of treatment and, on receiving such a letter, might find it disturbing and upsetting. Coping with the disease is difficult enough for most of us.Surely the NHS is looking for ways to save money? The envelope contained a two page letter, a questionnaire and a Cancer Research UK brochure explaining breast screening. Wouldn't this communication help in that area too?This is but one example, I imagine there must be many others in different medical specialties. If I can find the answer from my GP, I will let you know.
