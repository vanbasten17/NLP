The current disillusionment with India's new government is not surprising given the images built up in the past by prime minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Arun Jaitley. Modi, a powerful regional politician, blasted his way to power in a presidential style campaign with the theme that he alone could save India from its declining economic record and international image. Jaitley, a highly rated lawyer, spent years getting increasingly angry on television programmes and elsewhere as he barked and bit his way into the Congress-led coalition's failings as if he knew what ought to have been doneInevitably, neither man has lived up to the implicit promises of their self-confident performances before and during the general election campaign. Jaitley produced a drab Budget speech on July 10 that one leading commentator, Swaminathan Aiyar, dubbed (referring to the last finance minister) a "Chidambaram budget with saffron lipstick". I thought that a bit unfair on Paliannapen Chidambaram, who did manage to put some vision and inspiration into his speeches, even if he wasn't able to deliver the visions afterwards.Despite taking a firm line on government administration issues where he is trying to introduce efficiency, Modi has yet to display the sure touch on policy that his reputation indicated. Indeed, it looks as if he had underestimated the difficult if not impossible task of transferring his Gujarat chief minister style to the far more complex national and international arena of New Delhi. It is of course far too early to make sweeping judgements, but so far he has failed to deliver on his Obama-style "Yes we can" message, to which he added "Yes we will do" last August.I've been out of India since just before Budget Day and these views are culled from people I have met and talked to in Washington DC as the budget was being delivered, and in the UK, as well as reading the India news and comment. In the policy think tanks around Washington's Dupont Circle, analysts thought the Budget good in parts, but were understandably disappointed that Jaitley did not take a clear stand on subsidies and against a damaging policy of retrospective corporate taxation pursued by the last government (initially over a Vodafone take-over deal and then affecting other companies).Swapan Dasgupta, a communist and self-declared staunch Modi admirer, has questioned Jaitley's decision not to ditch the last government's over-optimistic figures on the economy, writing: "There are things that just don't add up. Jaitley may have preserved the honour of his Finance Ministry by not rubbishing the entire past, but what sort of signal has it sent to the bureaucracy that will oversee the big changes Modi contemplates? Continuity has its pitfalls and the most obvious one is that the Modi dispensation is in serious danger of being led by the nose by a bureaucracy that is most at ease with perpetuating the status quo through control. Certainly the main body of the Budget speech conveyed the unmistakable impression of having been penned by someone who was completely impervious to its political rationale and made the seamless transition from UPA to NDA."Dasgupta seemed to be suggesting that Jaitley had accepted the views of his finance ministry bureaucrats' and said that Modi's efforts to motivate and directly drive senior bureaucrats, Gujarat-style, would not work until "babudom grasps the reality of political change". At present, he says, "there is no indication of such a realisation", and the Indian bureaucracy still thinks the achche din [good days] has been never-ending".On the positive side Jaitley did indicate a new focus on economic growth, with the prospect of urgently needed agricultural and taxation reforms. The few details he announced included an increase in foreign direct investment limits in defence equipment manufacturing and insurance companies from 26% to 49%, and a boost for government spending on highways. He also repeated an announcement made more than once by the last government that FDI in insurance companies, which needs parliamentary approval (unlike defence and other areas), would be raised from 26% to 49%.Meanwhile, Modi seems to be more willing to be tougher and more abrasive on the Bharatiya Janata Party's Hindu nationalist interests and causes than on economic policy and sorting out the way that India is run.In Budget week, he appointed Amit Shah (above), his controversially tough and apparently ruthless political henchman as president of the BJP, despite an on-going criminal investigation into Shah's alleged involvement in Gujarat police killings and phone tapping. Shah has been close to Modi since they were both teenagers in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which lays down doctrine and played a large part in the recent election campaign by providing thousands of volunteers.There have also been moves to have a new look at India's history and rewrite education books, as the last BJP-led government did in the early 2000s, along with other initiatives aimed at adjusting India's approach to culture so that it fits with Hindu nationalist views.It's easier of course to do these things than it is to reform the way that India and its economy is run. The government however won its overwhelming general election victory because people want economic and other changes, not because they are devoted fans or followers of the BJP's long-term nationalist ambitions.A longer version of this article is on John Elliott's Riding the Elephant blog at http://wp.me/pieST-28N
