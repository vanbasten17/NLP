Next week school students around the nation will sit down to do the NAPLAN test and just how well they perform could - some experts say - impact the demand and price for certain family homes.Daniel Godoy, sales director of First National in Carlingford, in Sydney's northwest, says being in a particular primary school catchment can add $40,000 to the price of a home in his area.The two sought-after schools around his patch are Carlingford West Public School and North Rocks Public School. Students at both schools have performed exceptionally well in previous NAPLAN tests.However, demand for at least one - North Rocks Public School - is not just built around the NAPLAN results for that school."As soon as they announced the OC [opportunity classes] about five years ago in North Rocks, the prices really did shoot up," says Godoy."Everyone that enquiries always asks about what catchment [the property] is in."In Adelaide, Rosalind Neale, managing directorâ€¨ of Neale Realty, says people seek out certain school zones."They'll even rent in there so as they can at least get their children into those schools, so it is quite a big factor."I must admit when I am selling properties that are close to these schools, I always push that."Much of the demand is built around word-of-mouth though."I would say that a lot of it is reputation but when you think about it, a lot [of people] coming from overseas ... they're very keen to get their children into those areas so I would say they are also looking at that on the [MySchool] website."On Sydney's North Shore, Ian Clarke, director of Belle Property Killara, says being closer to a certain school won't necessarily improve the price of a property.Clarke works in an area spoilt for choice of better-performing schools, based on NAPLAN testing, including Beaumont Road Public School, Killara Public School and Killara High School. There's also a host of well-regarded private schools."Predominantly most people are coming up to the North Shore because of the schooling in general, both private and public," Clarke says."The demand generally is high in the area because of people chasing accessibility to schools."In Melbourne, David Gillham, director and auctioneer at Noel Jones Camberwell says he's been seeing demand for a certain school - Balwyn High School - for the last three decades.The demand is particularly strong from buyers with Asian backgrounds and preceded the introduction of NAPLAN testing in 2008."They do pay extraordinary prices for property to get into that particular one," says Gillham."I can't quantify a price difference but I can certainly quantify interest - it's either that they would buy it or they wouldn't [if it was not in the right school zone]."
