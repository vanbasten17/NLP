An outdoor dishwasher, an air-conditioner with a "human sensor" and a robotic lawn mower are among the finalists in the lauded There's 105 finalists in this year's awards across a bunch of categories, and many of them are products we could use at home.Here's seven that caught my eye.As the proud owner of a robotic floor cleaner (of which a version  also features in the Australian International Design Awards), an  automatic lawn mower sounds like heaven.Husqvarna brought out its first version in 1995 and promises this  version is "silent and efficient, emits no exhaust gases and features  low energy consumption". You can see .It suits lawns up to 500 square metres, and sells for $1999.I'm not sure if I want to wash my dishes outside, but if I did, it seems ASKO has the answer with an alfresco dishwasher.The company claims it's the first dishwasher specifically designed for outdoor use in Australia.  It has a stainless steel top, back, and sides for protection from the elements.And just so you don't annoy the neighbours with more noise once the party is over, it operates at a low 48dB(A). But it comes at a hefty price - $2999.Since Kleenmaid has relaunched in Australia under new ownership it is keen to be seen as a product leader.This oven has made it into the awards thanks to its usefulness to  people with disabilities and older folk, but you could see Kleenmaid's  Elevator Oven appealing to a broader market - parents of very young kids  for example, who want to keep them away from touching the oven.The Elevator Oven is set in to the benchtop so there is no heavy oven  door to be negotiated. The oven is raised and lowered by a button.And of course, to get hot things out of the oven, you don't need to bend down.It certainly is a clever idea. Fujitsu's "Human Sensor" operates the air-conditioner by detecting the movement of people within a room and reducing the capacity and energy use of the air-con if the room is left unoccupied after 20 minutes.Although split systems can be a good heating and cooling solution, they never tend to look great on walls. This design helps by concealing the louvres and LED indicators when the unit is turned offIt has 4-star energy efficiency rating on its cooling and heating modes. Prices start from $895.The name of the maker alone deserves an award - Big Ass Fan Company. Whether or not its fan does, remains to be seen. But it is creating a bit of a stir in design circles.The manufacturer argues that Haiku delivers an 80 per cent improvement in energy efficiency over conventional ceiling fans while "its aerofoils move large amounts of air with minimum resistance for maximum efficiency".Energy use aside, it certainly looks sexy. It comes in bamboo, white and black. But hold your breath for the price - $1100 for the bamboo and $900 for the white or black versions.An old plastic bottle has never looked so good!EchoPanel® Mura from Woven Image is low in volatile organic compounds and is made from 60 per cent recycled post-consumer content and has GreenTag Environmental Certification.The 1.9mm thick wall covering is engineered to provide a texture that will mould to surfaces, which the maker says results in a "more forgiving wall covering product for uneven substrates".You can get it printed in an array of colours and designs. It is also available embossed.First this company came up with a way of connecting a house to rainwater and pressurised mains at the same time, switching automatically between the two as needed.Now Davey has teamed up with Tankworks and put together an all-in-one system that eliminates the messy set up of having a pump sat next to the tank - usually in its own tank cover - and also the challenge of filtering the water to an acceptable level.The entire assembly is now located within the rainwater tank, where the submersible pump and filters are tucked away under a lid and the noise output is contained.A large, built-in primary strainer and secondary micro-filtration protects downstream equipment and provides clean and attractive water quality.The pump can be used in a variety of tanksThis should really appeal to householders who want to use rainwater but want a clean, sleek look that feels hassle-free.
