Gallingly, Sidelines missed the conclusion of Channel 5's scientific search for Britain's Worst Wife on Sunday night. It was a close call between Laura (doesn't do the washing-up), Kelly (spends money on shoes), Kerry (cleans too much) and Jen (controls the purse-strings) in the horror stakes. But we're hoping the tasks set these wayward women - to cook their husbands a meal, mow the lawn, take out the rubbish, and set the video to record their husbands' favourite TV programme - has put them back on the path of proper wifedom. If not, ladies, please feel free to apply for one of our 380,000 single men.  One woman who has presumably completely given up on marriage,   divorce and life thereafter is Diana Bilinelli, who put her Â£140m divorce settlement up for sale this week. Granted to her in 1983 by a California judge after her then husband, Sheikh Mohammed al-Fassi, took another couple of wives, it includes homes in South Beach, London and Spain, two Boeing 707s, 36 cars, a yacht, 26 horses and a private zoo. More than 20 years later, Bilinelli has grown tired of trying to win back the money from the Saudi royal family, to whom her ex-husband transferred his assets by the time he died in 2002. Instead she has decided to sell on the debt "at a substantial discount". Perhaps she'd have more luck in resolving her post-marital arrangements if she dressed as a superhero and scaled a palace.  Three cheers for Paula Radcliffe, now officially restored to national treasure status following her marathon win in New York at the weekend. To be honest, Sidelines had no trouble warming to her in her Olympic incarnation anyway, having never managed a school cross-country run without breaking down in hysterical sobs. But having her back on winning form is even better, if only because it makes that dread phrase - "you run like a girl" - sound really very desirable. Wanted next: champion woman ball-thrower. What's wrong with under-arm, anyway?
