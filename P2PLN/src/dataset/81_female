In today's DMN: Senate panel approves three-year high plan for high schoolers in Dallas. OK, now that my head-spinning has slowed somewhat, let me try to unpack this argument.The goal of this pilot program is to free up money for full-day pre-K in Dallas. Great idea. But we get there, dollars-wise, by putting some percentage of high schoolers on a three-year program to graduation because, you know, they don't do much in their senior year anyway. And let's do this in a district where, as I recall, way more than half of all high school seniors are not college-ready after four years of high school work.Senate bill sponsor Royce West says, according to the DMN article: Part of the motivation for the program is senioritis, the inability of many seniors to accomplish much in their last year of high school, particularly those who have met most of their graduation requirements. "A lot of students just don't do that much academically in the fourth year," he said.There are many details to work out and the final product might not be as dire as I'm predicting. But call me suspicious at best on this "initiative." Let's not rob Peter to pay Paul. There has to be a better way.
