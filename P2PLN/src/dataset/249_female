The Reserve Bank may be feeling very comfortable with having left rates on hold - as revealed in its February board meeting minutes released this week - but the jury is still out among economists as to whether borrowers are in for any more cuts this year.On one side of the fence is CommSec chief economist Craig James, who is predicting that rates are now on hold unless we suffer a left-of-field shock that causes the Reserve Bank Board to wield its knife only once more before Christmas.On the other is Bank of America Merrill Lynch's chief economist for Australia and New Zealand, Saul Eslake, who believes the Reserve Bank is far from finished with its axe."We're still looking for two more rate cuts this year - most likely next month, if, as I expect, the capital expenditure intentions data that's released on the 28th of this month is poor, and subsequently [we're anticipating another cut] probably in June or July," Eslake says.While the Reserve Bank says the 175 basis points it has cut the cash rate by since Melbourne Cup 2011 is starting to have an impact, Eslake is not so sure.In its minutes, the Reserve Bank notes: "While conditions remained soft in the construction industry, there were some signs that the housing market had firmed, partly due to the series of interest rate reductions over 2012."Notwithstanding month-to-month volatility, building approvals had increased since the middle of 2012, particularly in states other than Victoria, and prices and rental yields in the established housing market had also picked up."But Eslake says he's not seeing "a lot of evidence that housing is picking up in the way that you might have expected". "Historically you would have expected a more vigorous response to that then you've actually seen," he says."I think it probably will take further reductions in interest rates for a clearer recovery in housing to be apparent."There are some signs that investors are responding to low interest rates. You can see that in the investor borrowing numbers and also in the local government approvals for apartments and flats, but where you can't really see anything compelling is evidence of a turnaround in the market for traditional detached dwellings."While housing is no longer "going south ... it doesn't appear to have turned up decisively as yet", says Eslake.However, CommSec's Craig James is already talking of a time when the Reserve Bank may have to start tightening monetary policy."If the global environment continues to improve, we get a pick-up in the economy domestically, the Reserve Bank at some point in time late this year, early next year, will have to think about lifting rates to more normal levels," he says."But I think that's some way off. I think significant rate cuts are not on the agenda and I don't think rate hikes are on the agenda at the moment."One thing is for sure, all eyes and ears will be on Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens when he appears before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics at Parliament House in Canberra this Friday."Perhaps we'll get some more words of wisdom on Friday and that will tell us about where interest rates are headed and where the Reserve Bank has got its preferences," says James.
