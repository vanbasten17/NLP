	Dear Mr. Nadella,
	This is just a little email to say "Thanks Buddy!" I want to take a second out of your busy, busy day to express my gratitude for having the guts to finally let us women in on the secret for making the big bucks like the big boys: Karma!
	Yesterday, when I watched your brilliant address at the Celebration of Women in Computing conference, I, for one, sat there in shock, and not a little awe.
	How generous to finally let us little ladies know that being pushy gets us nowhere, and advising women that not asking for a raise is, in your words, just plain, "good karma."
	It's also good to know that the expression, "Karma's a bitch," is a universal female workforce truth. No wonder your name is Satya, which means "truth."
	Sort of tragic, though, that for years we dopey dames have been carping about making only 78% of what you guys make, working our asses off and begging for raises, when it was all unnecessary.
	Question is, why did it take a man to finally tell us that we women should just sit back, relax and let karma pay the bills? Simply knowing that we are born spiritual welfare recipients takes such a burden off us all.
	I just wish I'd learned early in my career to let karma take its course instead of pushing, fighting and trying to make a buck. Or at least the same buck the male editors were making at the women's magazines I worked for. Believe you me, Mr. N., life would have been a lot easier. Instead, like a chump, I worked like an animal every day to support my family. Alone.
	So instead, I screamed, begged and took extra jobs at night. The thing that concerns me, however, is that there's a real chance that I was a serial killer in a former life. Because seriously, Mr. Nadella, my "big raise karma" has been a real bitch.
	Best, Linda
