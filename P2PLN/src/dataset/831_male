I'm not one for infographics normally but I like this one from the Wealth Management Association which summarises at-a-glance the history of tax-free investments since personal equity plans were first launched by Margaret Thatcher's government back in the 80s. Does it serve any useful purpose? Not much, apart from a reminder of how much things have moved on and the fact that I've been writing about these tax-free wrappers for more than a quarter of a century!Back then you could only stash away £2,400 in a tax-free account - and only if you invested in shares. That was part of Thatcher's fairly successful attempt to turn us all into shareholders. Now you can put up to £11,520 in an individual savings account, and there are two types, which a cash Isa running alongside the original stocks and shares one.Interestingly, if you'd used your allowance every year since 1987 and invested in the right fund, you'd be sitting on more than a million now. You would have stashed away £203,760 - not including the current 2013-14  tax year - but if you'd put it all into the Fidelity Special Situations  fund, your nest egg would have grown to £1,542,000. That would have  been a profit of £1,338,240.If only it were that easy to make profits!Click on the infographic to see the full detail...
