Can it get any more catty on As if renovation stress, thrown in with a heart attack, a builder walking off the job and a cranky foreman are not enough, there's neighbours scheming against neighbours - and then happily picking apart their fellow contestants' hard work.What could have been bland TV has worked out to be anything but - not so much for the colour selections (all those white kitchens - although Mark and Duncan with some late help from Dale did pull off a great fish tank), the good use of space (Phil and Amity's mezzanine and laundry morphing into a bathroom), but for the personalities, the hissy fits and the plain old scheming.It  but it doesn't seem just yet that mainstream Australia has lost interest in reno dramas, with But if the tears and traumas on  aren't enough to put you off for renovating for real - because perhaps you think all the onscreen drama has been hammed up - Relationships Australia counsellor David Cutler says he's seen all this and more plenty of times in real life."Renovation is a wonderful thing but it's the most amazing stress on a couple," he says."It's a huge thing to take on and it probably means they're living under the pressure that you see on the television."Cutler says couples often don't realise before they start renovating just how much they are going to have to deal with conflict."Things go wrong all the time. You're faced with finding more things that needed to be done than you expected to do, going over your budget by several tens of thousands [of dollars], those sorts of things, which put all the added pressure on a couple."# Decide if you are both committed to the project. It is easier to get through if you both really want to do it.# Consider in advance who will do what, and who will be responsible for certain decisions, down to who will choose tiles and taps.# Learn to listen reflectively. "Hold on to your own thoughts while you listen to the other person's thoughts," Cutler advises.# Be prepared to follow suggestions from your partner. Cutler, who is the manager of Relationships Australia program Mensplace in Western Australia, says men sometimes struggle with this. "It really helps if the guy can actually listen and accept what his partner is saying without feeling overcriticised," says Cutler.# Remember to have some fun and take time out from the project. Sometimes, "it just becomes too hard and too all-encompassing so there's no other fun", says Cutler. "Make sure that there's time away from it."
