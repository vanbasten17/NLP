This blog is written on the fly, latching onto whatever catches my eye in the world of books, and as such is happily prey to its fashions and fads. Book designers are in the business, among other things, of making books stand out and be noticed, and I'm in the business of noticing books.That said, the seemingly incessant increase in book production and re-issuance, and the sometimes frantic attempts to make similar products look different, can make the books that don't stand out, stand out. So it was when I was in Waterstone's Piccadilly the other day and saw a table of what looked like unloved second-hand hardbacks, stacked, jacketless, in colourful piles, I immediately headed over.These were Slightly Foxed Editions, from the book publishing arm of the now ten-year-old literary quarterly that largely celebrates the out of print, unfashionable and forgotten books and authors of what I'm tempted to call yesteryear.SF Editions have been around for roughly half that time, and here's their deal: memoirs - some but not all out of print - mostly published between the 1960s and 1980s but obviously dealing with the world of decades before, going from well-known names such as Graham Greene, Dodie Smith and Edward Ardizzone to new (to me) writers like Richard Hillyer, PY Betts and Christabel Bielenberg (author of the singularly titled 'The Past is Myself').Production: small-ish hardbacks, dustjacketless, with differing colour boards - all blind embossed with the fox logo - and contrasting, unpatterned endpapers; nice heavy cream paper ("80gsm weight fine cream wove produced to order"); ribbon bookmarks; and each coming in a limited run of 2,000, which means that some of the early, sold out editions are now apparently fetching high prices on the second market - which has a subtle irony to it, seeing as the books are seemingly designed to look like the kinds of books you'd absentmindedly pick up in an junk/antique somewhere on a weekend outing, then decide not to buy. Yet here they are, looking gloriously out of place in the middle of the rampantly modern and individuated shelves of a major contemporary bookshop.The books are printed by Smith Settle of Yorkshire, who also do Foxed quarterly, and the finished product is indeed a delight. It sits happily in the hand and sits open well on the table.I asked Slightly Foxed what their inspirations were for the look of the books, and in reply they tipped a nod to the Oxford University Press World's Classics series (of which I have only one, small scale example) and the Jonathan Cape Travellers Library, though also noting the old style Everyman Modern Library - for the gold lettering on the spine. I do have some of these, are the Foxed books do look good alongside them, just slightly smaller.In one way it's a brave entry into the publishing world, to produce something that looks so resolutely old-fashioned - down to the small print size and margins, as though from an earlier age of austerity, though the bright colours of some of the titles do push against that. In another way, however, it's entirely reasonable. After all, there is nothing more dated than an old memoir, and indeed no form more inherently conservative than that one, which authors usually turn to once they have made their name, and can settle for looking back along the march of progress, pointing out what has been lost. No revolutionaries among the authors on this list - you wouldn't publish Alexander Trocchi or Kathy Acker - though that said 'Hand-grenade Practice in Peking' (by Frances Wood) is a title to conjure with.Slightly Foxed Books are distinctive, but they're not alone in producing jacketless hardbacks. Not far from that table in Waterstones was a display of Notting Hill Editions books, another newcomer to the British publishing scene, and with an equally narrow remit.Only three years old, and styling itself 'Home of the Essay', NH Editions produce hardbacked editions of that genre-less non-fictional form. As well as first British publications for feted writers such as Roland Barthes and Thomas Bernhard, there are newly commissioned entries from Deborah Levy, Lavinia Greenlaw, and others.The books are slightly larger than Slightly Foxed's, with smoother boards and no ribbon, but - in a more contemporary twist - print the boards with title, author and a quote. If splitting the difference between tradition and modernity is the goal, then consider it a success. Inside there are some nice touches of colour to the page numbers and headers.And in fact one of the NH Editions that I own is that most radical of recent memoirs, Joe Brainard's I Remember, with its run of Twitter-length single-sentence paragraphs each beginning "I remember..."
