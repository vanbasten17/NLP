Despite the improved outcome for many breast cancer patients, the cancer still returns in 20 per cent of the 50,000 diagnosed every year. Researchers at Nottingham Trent University NHS Trust and the University of Nottingham may have discovered one of the reasons - a molecule called HAGE.Researchers tested tissue samples from over 2,000 patients with different types of breast cancer and found that HAGE presented itself in the cancer cells of 10 per cent of these patients - i.e. they were "HAGE-positive" - and was strongly associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis.That looks fairly straightforward but the researchers also found that the presence of HAGE can help to predict a patient's chance of recovery and their likely response to therapy.Women (no men on this study) whose cancer was considered to be a low risk, but who were HAGE-positive, were twice as likely to have a bad outcome as those low-risk patients whose tumours were "HAGE-negative".Conversely, researchers also found that for HAGE-positive patients, the molecule appears to limit the effectiveness of hormone therapy. High-risk patients who were HAGE-negative and were taking hormone therapy lived longer.HAGE can also predict a patient's response to chemotherapy. The research found that - after chemotherapy - the incidence of relapse in HAGE-positive patients was lower than those who were HAGE-negative. The reason for this is thought to be that the cells which express HAGE proliferate faster and are, therefore, more responsive to chemotherapy.Now that the "one-size-fits-all" model of treatment and medication has been discarded and "personalised medicine" has taken its place, the results of this research will help hugely towards designing the appropriate therapy for each patient. Low-risk HAGE-positive patients could be treated earlier and the use of hormone therapy and chemotherapy could be better assessed.The HAGE molecule is also known to trigger the immune system and this discovery could be the beginning of one of the paths to a breast cancer vaccine - which must be high on every researcher's wish list.Professor Stephen Chan, consultant oncologist at Nottingham City Hospital - and a visiting professor at Nottingham Trent University - said: "It's about personalising cancer treatments. These clinically significant findings could help us to decide when to intervene and in what way."Meanwhile, at Warwick University, researchers have developed a new drug that can manipulate the body's natural signalling and energy systems, allowing the body to attack and shut down cancerous cells.The drug - called ZL105 - is a compound based on the metal, iridium and is specifically designed not to attack DNA. It has the potential to replace current anticancer drugs, which become less effective over time because they "learn how they are being attacked"; which can damage healthy as well as cancerous cells; and which can cause debilitating side effects.Dr Isolda Romero-Canelon, co-author of the research paper, said: "ZL105 works by pushing the energy-producing machinery in the cancer cell over the limit. This causes them to slow and shut down - but healthy cells are unaffected and side effects significantly reduced."Her co-author, Professor Peter J Sadler said: "The drug is a catalyst and is active at low doses. It can attack cancer cells in multiple ways at the same time, so the cancer is less able to adapt to the new treatment."Preliminary data indicates that ZL105 may be 10 times more effective in treating - not only some types of breast cancer - but colon, melanoma, renal and ovarian. Figures for the latter, from Cancer Research UK, indicate that, in the UK, one woman dies of ovarian cancer every two hours.Across Europe, approximately 950,000 cancer patients receive radiotherapy each year, as a cost-effective anti-cancer treatment. Research scientists from a third University - Bath - have joined forces with CERN (European Organisation for Nuclear Research - the world's largest particle physics laboratory) to "develop new multi-modality tomography techniques to image tumours within the body". In simple language, these techniques will give Radiation Oncology medical teams a much clearer picture, allowing them to carefully target only tumorous cells, while protecting healthy cells.Professor Manjit Dosanijh, adviser for life sciences at CERN, said: "Ultimately, this will lead to more personalised radiotherapy treatment."These are but three examples of the work of our universities - all aiming for an improvement in the UK cancer survival rates by personalising treatment.
