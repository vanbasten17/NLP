With flood waters bearing down on your home, would you stay to defend it, or would you go?In the wake of the tragic loss of life in Queensland's flash foods last year, it is, for many, difficult to grasp why this week 90 per cent of the population of a tiny town called Hay, a mere dot on a vast, flat floodplain in the Riverina of NSW, are defying desperate pleas from the State Emergency Service to evacuate their homes.The mighty Murrumbidgee River is , lapping near the top of the town's recently beefed-up levee banks and threatening properties. The brown murky water is swirling with farm chemicals, sewerage, and even furniture and household knickknacks sucked from homes or sheds further upstream.Yet, locals remain defiant in the face of a major flood threat, with the Mayor, Bill Sheaffe, confidently telling media that, at his home in the aptly named Flood Street, a mere 25 metres from the water's edge, he doesn't think he'll be hearing any bubbling noises.To grasp why residents when all that separates their homes, children and pets from flooding is a dirt bank and some hessian bags filled with sand, you need some understanding of the town itself.When poet Dorothea Mackellar wrote of "A sunburnt country ...A land of sweeping plains ... Of droughts and flooding rains" she could well have been sitting under a shop veranda in the wide main street of Hay, where farm kids with broad Akubras and even broader accents stroll from Antonakas Hardware to the Hay Fish Shop, mixing with townies emerging from one of the few free swimming pools in the state, and returning from water-skiing the Murrumbidgee at more subdued levels.Anyone who has completed the mind-numbingly long 16-hour drive from Sydney to Adelaide will tell you that the midpoint, Hay, is a long way from anywhere. The nearest "big town" of Griffith (population 25,000) is 160 kilometres drive, or, closer at hand, at 120 kilometres away, is Deniliquin, home to about 7500 people.Hay is on one of the flattest sections of land in the world - driving there you feel like you are traversing a snow dome, flat as tack wherever you look with the whole sky arcing magnificently over your head.From the  highest to the lowest point, there is a difference in elevation of only  17 metres. That may bring with it floods, but it's also part of the reason the  townsfolk believe that even if the levees do fail, the inundation  wouldn't be significant.Cr Sheaffe argues that if the water breached  the banks, it would only rise to about a metre in the deepest parts of  town. It's a scenario vastly different to the shocking scenes of flash  flooding in Queensland last year that saw water engulf whole houses.Hay's isolation has shaped the town's psyche. Being far from anywhere means that when you encounter a problem, most times you have to fix it yourself. A shortage of trades in the town has made locals pretty handy, adept at solving, among other things, minor plumbing and electrical problems.It's also a town full of farmers and farm hands, who have, since they were mere toddlers, worked with the land at their parents' feet. Many of the properties around Hay are also irrigated, and locals from that industry feel confident in their knowledge of water and levee banks.The Murrumbidgee snakes its way through the red, brown and grey clays of Hay, separating the lower-lying South Hay, from the slightly higher northern part of the community, which houses the main street and its shops and businesses.Most townsfolk feel they can know and trust the Murrumbidgee like an old friend. She may have threatened them before, back in 2010, '74, and '56, but if the people were able to hold back her quiet rage then, why shouldn't they now, residents assert.Driving through Hay you can easily see that years of drought have ravaged residents' incomes, and savings. Like so many other rural towns that have struggled in recent years, many of the predominantly fibro and weatherboard homes in this isolated outpost are showing significant wear and tear.Sale signs that hung a year ago outside some homes are still in place, as the after-effects of the drought continue to bite the buying capacity of existing residents, and cause others to pack up their bags and leave.Hay's population declined from 3822 to 3383 in the 10 years to the 2006. Changes to way land is farmed are also thought to have played their part in the population fall.Although now firmly over, the enduring drought is part of the reason why some locals are refusing to budge - after years of doing it tough and running up big debts, they simply can't afford to shut up shop until the flood waters are actually seeping under the door, they argue.Understandably the SES are frustrated, arguing that it is unfortunate that the majority of residents did not heed the evacuation order because "it is in the interests of public safety to ensure their safety".By week's end the mighty Murrumbidgee will have spoken either way - by continuing to ebb and flow further downstream, or by turning on the very people who trust her so much.
