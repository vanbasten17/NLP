Today I noticed that Morrisons Supermarkets has chosen "Help the Hospices" as their charity of the year.  This is a very good choice.  The charity does excellent work and helps thousands of people.Perhaps, in working alongside "Help the Hospices",  Morrisons has learned just how important is diet.The supermarket chain could play more of a role providing for the needs of its customers by ensuring that all its stores carry the full range of organic and "free-from" foods - both ready-made products and the ingredients with which to make your own.  This would be of enormous help to those customers for whom diet is key.  Too often the selection is modest.Surely the company must be aware that it is vital for people recovering from cancer - and many other illnesses - to know exactly what they are eating.  Not everyone has the time to bake their own bread, make their own soup or concoct their own smoothies.  People suffer from allergies - so they need to know if foods like nuts, wheat or gluten are in the product.So - that brings me back to my previous question.  How come the "speciality breads" - unlike all other bread sold in the store - do not carry a list of ingredients on the packaging?Emailing Morrisons Customer Services is particularly tricky because, having received an answer - which I did and which was useless because it ignored completely the point I was trying to make - I discovered then that it was not possible to reply to the email address from which the Customer Services sent their response.  This means you have to go back to the website and start again - all very frustrating and hardly a service to the customer.Perhaps Morrisons would now like to explain their policy - and a loophole in the food laws is not a good enough answer.
