It's probably the last thing you feel like doing after a lazy summer break but the January slowdown offers the perfect time to take a fresh look at your home loan.And with advertised interest rates across lenders varying by nearly 3 per cent, it's a task well worth undertaking.Of course, it's not as simple as diving into the cheapest rate on offer - you'll need to look at comparison rates to understand the true cost of the mortgage, including any fees and charges, and also consider whether bells and whistles such as a redraw facility and mortgage offset account are on offer.You'll also want to do your sums on any costs associated with changing providers and get a grip on whether switching to a cheaper provider will in fact save you money over the remaining life of your loan.While the majority of borrowers refinancing will hop between the four major lenders, there has been a slight shift - according to data from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) - to smaller providers.An analysis by loan comparison website finder.com.au shows the big four banks - ANZ, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, NAB and Westpac - collectively lost almost 1 per cent of the owner-occupied and investment home loan market share in the 12 months to the end of November.The big four banks together dropped market share for outstanding home loans from 85.27 per cent in November 2012 to 84.50 per cent in November 2013.This is a turnaround from the previous period (November 2011 to November 2012), when the big four collectively grew their market share by 3.04 per cent (from 82.23 percent to 85.27 per cent).The biggest shift (by 0.89 per cent ) was among owner-occupiers.However, Michelle Hutchison, a spokeswoman for finder.com.au, says the big four banks still hold the lion's share of home loans.Hutchison says the big four banks' average (advertised) discounted variable rate (based on a $300,000 loan) is 5.29 per cent, while variable rates from other lenders start from 4.61 per cent. "There are 69 variable rate home loans below 5.29 per cent in [our] database," she says.Four new banks listed in the past year - Bank of Sydney, Police Bank, Police Financial Services Limited and Woori Bank - still hold only a miniscule 0.21 per cent of bank market share of home loans.On the back of the lowest home loans in decades, another trend is emerging as more borrowers opt for the perceived security of fixed-rate home loans.Demand for fixed-rate home loans climbed in almost every state during December.Data from Mortgage Choice shows demand for fixed rate home loans jumped to 33.06 per cent in December - up from 30.56 per cent the month prior.Mortgage Choice spokeswoman Jessica Darnbrough says demand for fixed rate products hadn't been this high since March 2008."Despite the fact that we saw several lenders raise the interest on their fixed rate products over the past few months, this type of product remains very popular with borrowers," Darnbrough says. "In the current economic environment ... it is not surprising."Demand for fixed rate products increased in every state except NSW, which recorded a 0.58 per cent drop.Queensland recorded the largest increase - 44 per cent of all home loans written in the Sunshine State in December were for fixed rates.Overall though, variable rate home loans continue to prove the most popular amongst borrowers, accounting for 66.94 per cent of all home loans written in December.Â
