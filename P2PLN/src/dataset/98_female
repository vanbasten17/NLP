I ended my day yesterday with visions of this nightmarish graphic dancing in my head, courtesy of colleague Nicole Stockdale. In her tweet regarding this "scariest statistic about the newspaper business today," Nicole noted this isn't news to DMN staff, because our publisher has shown similar graphics at our annual employee meetings.But it's still not the kind of information you want to see just before bedtime!So tonight I plan to set aside my Twitter feed and instead reread this hopeful Matthew Yglesias piece from Slate, entitled "The Glory Days of American Journalism." It's in no way a rebuttal of the Pew statistics. But it does note all the things that are right in our industry today. OK,so these are things that are going right for those who are consuming news — not trying to make a living in journalism. Bottom line from Yglesias: The "American news consumer has never had it so good."He also makes some great points about ways in which consumers of health care and higher education could benefit if those industries are ever — due to competition — forced to use the tactics that competition has forced on the news-gathering business. Yglesias says if there is any problem facing journalism it's that the industry is "suffering from a crisis of productivity."Worth a read, whether you are in the news business or another field.
