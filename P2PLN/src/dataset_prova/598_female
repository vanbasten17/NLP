It seems shameful to admit to not being able to blow-dry my hair. Along with applying lipstick without a mirror, it's one of those essential skills I've somehow managed to skip. But Darren, artistic director at the Clipso salon in London's Fitzrovia, wants to reassure me that there is no real secret to it. All you need, he says, is patience, coordination and a lot of 'product'. I tell him that, if I'm not running too late and there's nothing interesting on the radio, I can spend 15 minutes styling my hair, which he thinks not disgraceful. So we set to work with a brush, a dryer, various potions, a mirror and me somewhere in between, not quite mastering the knack of using my reflection to know left from right and forward from back.  Darren's 10-point programme for kink-free tresses might be a little beyond me, but his number one rule - keep pulling the hair straight while it cools - has served me and my locks pretty well ever since. I'm still not so good with mirrors, though.  Clipso blow-drying lesson, Â£50 for an hour, 020-7580 3449.
