The Conservative MP Penny Mordaunt had the House of Commons in stitches as she became only the second woman to propose the loyal address in Queen Elizabeth II's reign - and certainly the first to mention testicles.Speaking of her pleasure that more women were serving in the armed forces and might in future be allowed to fight on the frontline, Mordaunt told an anecdote about her own naval training on how to care for your penis and testicles in the field. The organisers clearly did not anticipate that some of the people due to attend had been issued with the incorrect kit, she said.Mordaunt, a 41-year old sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve, was elected for Portsmouth North in 2010. She is probably best known outside the Commons and her constituency for taking part in ITV's diving contest, Splash! Cameron called Mordaunt a "real parliamentary star" after she spoke.By convention, two backbenchers propose and second a "loyal address", which is a thank-you motion to the Queen following her speech. One is usually a promising MP early in their political career, while the other is a longstanding parliamentarian.Mordaunt began her address with a reference to her predecessor, Lady Tweedsmuir, who ended her speech 57 years ago with a call for more women MPs.The MP said she was delighted to be one of two women involved in the loyal address, as the Lib Dem MP Annette Brooke would be seconding. Some might see her and Brooke as the Thelma and Louise of a coalition, driving over the cliff towards electoral defeat, she said, but this would not be the case "because unlike a 1966 Thunderbird, the coalition is right-hand drive".A central theme of Mordaunt's speech was Portsmouth. She praised Portsmouth's fan-owned football club as well as its community spirit for rescuing a Tudor manor house and gardens which are home to a hedgehog, christened Eric Prickles.Speeches that follow the Queen's speech are traditionally more humorous than the usual tone of the Commons. In his speech afterwards, Ed Miliband said: "It certainly takes guts to get in a bathing costume and dive off the high board. I say that is nothing: she should try wrestling a bacon sandwich live on national television."
