Tactical voting is supposed to work against the incumbent party. Newark may be remembered as the first byelection that shows it can work against the insurgents, because in part the result seems to be explained by an anti-Ukip tactical vote."My lifelong Labour mum is voting Tory today to keep Ukip out of Newark," the author Matt Haig said on Twitter on Thursday. Haig's mum wasn't alone. Labour and Lib Dem campaigners in the constituency both claim to have picked up evidence that some of their supporters were going to vote Conservative to ensure Ukip lost, and some Tories said they were hearing the same story from people pledging support to them."A lot of our voters had transferred to vote against Ukip to make sure Ukip didn't get elected," David Watts, the Lib Dem candidate, said on Friday, as he sought to explain why the Lib Dem vote shrunk to just 2.6%.Partly this may have been a reaction against Roger Helmer, the Ukip candidate, whose reactionary views on subjects such as homosexuality, rape and immigration have generated controversy. But Helmer himself used to be a Conservative MEP, and so anyone voting tactically against him would have been voting Conservative to keep out a former Conservative.It is just as likely they were voting against Ukip as a whole, and that anti-Ukip tactical voting has emerged as a response to the way Ukip hardened its anti-immigration stance before the European elections, with Nigel Farage, the party leader, complaining about hearing foreign languages being spoken on the train and saying people should worry about Romanian families moving into their street.Tactical voting, a byproduct of the first-past-the-post electoral system, has been a factor in British elections for decades. Most commonly it worked against the Conservatives, with Labour or Lib Dem supporters switching to back the non-Conservative candidate most likely to win.It was a crucial factor in the periodic Liberal/SDP/Lib Dem byelection triumphs that eventually gave the Lib Dems a sizeable presence in the House of Commons, enough to make them a partner in the coalition.But the Lib Dems were able to exploit tactical voting in part because (before tuition fees) they did not arouse strong hostility. Farage's problem is that, while his party has grown increasingly popular, it has also grown increasingly unpopular, and people are now willing to trade their votes to keep it out.According to YouGov, 37% of people said they felt generally negative towards Ukip in 2009. That figure has now shot up to 53%.Another poll shows that people are more likely to say they will definitely not vote Ukip (52%) than Conservative (49%) or Labour (38%).Farage wants Ukip to be the "earthquake" that disrupts Britain's political establishment and, in the European elections (which use a proportional electoral system, not first-past-the-post), he did achieve his goal of the toppling the main parties.But in elections for Westminster he is finding it harder to achieve equivalent success. Newark was the fourth byelection in a row where Ukip came second. Tactical voting helps to explain why he may find making a further breakthrough particularly difficult.
