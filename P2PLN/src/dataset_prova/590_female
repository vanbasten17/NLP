9.51am: Good morning and welcome to the Guardian's newsdesk live blog.Today I'll be focusing on our coverage of the Eurozone debt crisis. For those who want to read the latest news developments, our business live blog and Andrew Sparrow's politics blog can bring you up to speed.Here we'll be asking what readers want from our coverage - does the world of credit rating agencies and "negative outlooks" need more explanation? What would you like our business and politics reporters to be looking into?Do post questions and ideas below the line, or tweet me @Claire_Phipps10.57am: The 10 o'clock editorial conference was, unsurprisingly, dominated by talk of the decision by Moody's ratings agency to put the UK on "negative outlook".Our economics editor,  Larry Elliott, had a stab at explaining the consequences of the move in terms of chemistry tests and red roses (if you get three out of 10 in a chemistry test, it doesn't matter as long as everyone else scores two out of 10).The red roses represent austerity, apparently - you can't stop giving them to an object of your affection without them thinking something is up ... hence no u-turn from George Osborne?11.41am: I've asked Graeme Wearden, who's running the business live blog, to respond to some of the suggestions readers are posting below - particularly on whether our Eurozone crisis coverage should be more global. I'll add his response when I get it.I'm also looking into the possibility of translating reporting and analysis from the foreign press and commentators, and whether we can link to some (reputable) explanations of the sometimes tricky jargon that seems to be an inevitable part of these stories.More soon.1.07pm: Our daily 12 o'clock editorial meeting, in which we shape the next day's paper, has just finished. Martin Farrer, who is editing the business pages, has outlined some of the pieces that are lined up for this evening, and they take in some of the points made by posters below the line, particularly about the global context of all this.On the issue of demystifying the jargon around the debt crisis, I've had various suggestions via Twitter (@Claire_Phipps), including this one:Would a Guardian version of this be useful, do you think?2.40pm: My colleague Graeme Wearden, who often anchors the eurocrisis live blog, has responded to some of the points you've raised:3.54pm: The idea of a glossary to help unravel some of the jargon around the debt crisis, as suggested by ballymichael, has prompted a useful conversation on the news desk. Graeme Wearden points out that there is a business glossary here but parts have not been updated for a while, and we don't think it necessarily best reflects the terms that readers would like to see explained.We're going to have a look at how to update that glossary and to find a way to place it automatically on web pages - be they the business live blog or analysis pieces - so it's always easily accessible for readers who want to know more about the background and/or technicalities.4.37pm: I'm wrapping up the blog for today, but thank you to all who posted and tweeted with ideas and suggestions. They've all been fed back to the business desk team, and we will be looking at ways to implement some of them over the coming days and weeks.Tomorrow on the blog we'll be looking at a fresh aspect of our news commissioning process - as ever, all contributions welcome.
