You can see that conversation here.On Wednesday 30 January from 2pm GMT, we'll be talking about changes to disability benefits, which will see the end of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for working-age claimants, replaced by Personal Independence Payments (PIP).Here's what the Department for Work and Pensions says about the change.The DWP has also published what it calls a "PIP myth-buster" here.However, many people are worried about what the changes will mean for them. Campaign group We Are Spartacus has published this guide. It says:Tell us: How will the change to PIP affect you or your family? Are the changes well understood? And how do you feel about the system under which claims will be assessed?Join us on Twitter between 2pm and 3pm GMT on Wednesday 30 January to share your views and ask questions.
