Glad to see the news that Dallas is taking steps to lose its dubious distinction of being only one of two top 10 U.S. cities that still allow smoking in city parks.Dallas city staff has begun drafting an ordinance to prohibit smoking on trails and in parks, which would include many of the large youth sports complexes, such as the one at Crawford Park in southeast Dallas.What kind of scope are we talking about? According to the City of Dallas website: 381 parks and 125 developed trail miles.Phoenix is the other city in the top 10 without a ban. Houston just jumped on this good-health bandwagon and is going big — with fines of up to $2,000.I'm a frequent runner on the Santa Fe and White Rock trails and can vouch for the unpleasantness of passing someone who is walking along puffing on his or her cancer stick. I don't think it does me any permanent harm, but, wow, it's enough to make me puke. Would love to see all those hard-working police officers on bikes force the smokers off the path.Many smokers will see a ban as another attack on their rights — right about now, they are muttering "if you can't smoke outside, where can you smoke"?Smoking is a person's right — as long as tobacco is legal. But the rights of many in some cases indeed do trump the rights of one. City parks would be a good example of where the rights of the many should prevail — especially when so many of them are children and youth. Here are some of what seem to me as common-sense reasons to prohibit lighting up in parks:- What are parks intended for if not promoting good health? There's just something inherently wrong in the mixed message of smoking and recreation.
- Don't our youngest residents deserve the cleanest possible environment for their play? And don't we want better role modeling for them?
- Not to mention that underage smokers, who didn't legally purchase those cigarettes, are often among the offenders. A ban gives them one fewer place to smoke without getting caught by their parents.
- Cigarette butts are not the worst offender among litter at our city parks, but they end up on the ground often enough to be a headache for park crews.
- I've left the health concerns to last on the list because I know critics will say you can find a study that supports most anything. But a multitude of those studies contend that "sitting 3 feet away from a smoker outdoors can expose you to the same level of secondhand smoke as if you were sitting indoors with a smoker."This change shouldn't cause a lot of hang-wringing over at City Hall. Again, the surprise is that we haven't already taken such a stand. According to the American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation, 990 communities have specified that their city parks be smoke-free. And this doesn't include all those that have some imposed some type limit.Will be eager for the park board to take up city staff recommendations and see how quickly we can improve the quality of our park experiences.What am I missing? Would love to hear ideas from readers, both pro and con, as I try to form the most persuasive arguments.
