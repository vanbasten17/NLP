After all, she is now officially the Most Powerful Woman in the World. And honestly, we're chuffed that coverage of her appointment has tended to concentrate on her impressively brainy achievements: child prodigy pianist, graduate at 19, professor at 26, former president of Stanford University - and only the odd snide finger pointing at her spinster status and "close friendship" with the president to spoil it. But no, sorry, we just can't manage it. If you're going to be a war-mongering, gun-toting, non-Bush-challenging hawk, Condi, the fact that you're also female just isn't enough to compensate. Cheers for ruining all our "if women ruled the world ..." fantasies. Hopefully, Cherie Blair - the Most Powerful Woman in the UK - is going to be exercising a little of that clout in Downing Street when the 40th-anniversary Pirelli calendar arrives in the post this week. Only 400 copies of the, er, arty calendar, which features famous models with their tops off, are distributed in the UK, with one going to the prime minister (was Margaret Thatcher once on the list, we wonder?) and six to Buckingham Palace - well, there are a lot of rooms, and you never want to be too far from a naked Sophie Dahl. Much as we'd like to advise Cherie to rip the thing to pieces, we can't help but note that a copy of the 2003 breast-fest sold recently on eBay for £9,000. News this week that Cherie was pictured wearing a £7,000 dress and £315 pair of Jimmy Choos at the Lord Mayor's banquet is presumably coincidental.
