10.05am: Good morning and welcome to the NHS reforms live blog. It's shaping up to be a busy day, with David Cameron's summit of health professionals - well, some of them - convening at Downing Street this afternoon, as the row over the health and social care bill shows no signs of calming.Our political editor Patrick Wintour reports that the prime minister has been accused of "divide and rule" tactics over the summit, excluding key NHS players such as the British Medical Association (BMA) and the Royal College of GPs. He writes:The Times (£) reports that it will be a meeting "of moderates and enthusiasts for the changes" and cites a source insisting: "The practicalities of scrapping the bill would be awful."Elsewhere, the Telegraph reports on claims - denied by hospital bosses - that Cameron had a hostile reception from staff at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary last week.We're working on a definitive guest list of who is and isn't invited to this afternoon's meeting - all contributions below the line or to @Claire_Phipps very welcome.11.21am: Some of those who haven't been invited to the official summit are heading to Downing Street today anyway. The "summit of the invited" will see some of those not on Cameron's guest list protest close to No 10 from midday.Professor Wendy Savage of Keep Our NHS Public said:We'll be asking our politics team at Westminster to go along to the unofficial summit to speak to some of those protesting.11.36am: Our health correspondent, Denis Campbell, has reported this morning on a report from the London School of Economics, which says that competition between NHS hospitals can boost efficiency and cut costs, but that the introduction of private-sector competition can result in "cherry-picking" and leave NHS hospitals with the poorest and most needy patients.Dr Zack Cooper, who led the study team, said:What do you think?11.44am: Denis Campbell has also been talking to healthcare professionals on and off the Downing St guest list. He reports that Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, which represents hospital doctors, is under pressure from within the organisation to boycott today's summit. The RCP is one of the few major medical organisations to have been invited.Denis writes:Professor Walter Holland is a former president of the Faculty of Public Health (FPH), which is part of the RCP and represents about 3,300 public health specialist in the NHS, local government and academia. It is also one of the organisations not to have been invited today; it recently called for the whole bill to be scrapped.Holland, now emeritus professor of public health medicine at the London School of Economics -- has written to Thompson:(Holland wrote the letter before it became clear that the British Medical Association, who are also in the 'drop the bill' camp, had not been invited either.)Denis adds:11.50am: The Press Association has just put out this from the regular Downing Street morning briefing. It appears we will not be issued with an official list of names for the summit. PA reports:11.55am: While we're working on our breakdown of who's invited (and not) to the Downing St summit, and where they each stand on the health and social care bill, I should point you in the direction of this handy summary from Ben Goldacre. Anyone else we should be checking on?12.03pm: I'm shortly handing over to my colleague Patrick Butler, who'll continue the blog, but you can tweet us both - @patrickjbutler and @Claire_Phipps - on this throughout the day, or comment below the line.Thanks for all your contributions so far.12.30pm: Hi, it's Patrick Butler, and I'll be hosting the NHS live blog for a while. Please leave comments below the line or tweet me at @PatrickJButler12.39pm: My colleague Denis Campbell reports that the Royal College of GPs has just issued a surprisingly mild statement about their exclusion from today's Number Ten summit.12.58pm: Blogger and activist Dr Éoin Clarke was the original source for the Telegraph piece on the prime minister's alleged altercation with a staff member during a visit to an NHS hospital in Newcastle last week.Clarke constantly updated his The Green Benches blog over the weekend as more pieces of the story came to light as a result of his digging. Both the Newcastle upon Tyne hospitals NHS trust and Downing street are adamant that no incident took place.Here's an extract from Clarke's summing up post on Sunday evening:Clarke adds:This is what the veteran trust chief executive Sir Len Fenwick told the Telegraph:If you were there, and can tell us more about it, please tweet me or email patrick.butler@guardian.co.uk1.07pm: Just picked up tweets from the BBC's Louise Stewart (@BBCLouise), who appears to be outside Downing street, where the summit is being held.Followed by:She then retweets Paul Twinn (@paultwinn), a BBC news producer:1.17pm: The BBC tweets in mysterious ways, as @latentexistence points out. Compare those tweets from BBC reporters on the spot in my 1.07pm post with this one from the official BBC Breaking news:It's all about perspective.1.33pm: Lots of Twitter interest in Lansley's impromptu encounter with protesters outside Downing street:@giovanni218 is exasperated:@ambushpredator has a different take:@cathbythesea is perhaps a little world-weary, and who can blame her:1.42pm: Here's some BBC footage of Andrew Lansley, the health secretary, as he is confronted outside 10 Downing street by a protester.@scribbles123 tweets:You can probably begin to understand why David Cameron, the prime minister, opted not to tell the public he was visiting a Newcastle hospital last week.1.53pm: This may not be Andrew Lansley's only encounter with an angry public (and health professionals) today: he's due to make an official visit to the Queen's hospital in Romford, Essex, this afternoon.I've just called the Department of Health press office and it has confirmed he's be going ahead with the trip. Let it never be said Lansley is not resillient.Meanwhile, Politics Home editor Paul Waugh has tweeted:2.15pm: Speculation has already started that forcing Lansley to enter Downing street past an angry group of protesters was part of a cunning Machiavellian plan on the part of Number 10:@sallygainsbury of the FT tweets:There's general consensus that the encounter has been a PR disaster for Lansley, and possibly for the government. Lilian Anekwe, editor of  BMJ Best Health (@LAnekwe), tweets:@tomdaviesE17 tweets:2.26pm: My colleague Denis Campbell wonders if the Royal College of Physicians - which attended the summit today - may yet withdraw its support for the bill.2.57pm: I'm picking up some snippets from the summit on Twitter.

Chris Ship, ITV news senior political correspondent Tweets: Andy Bell of  BBC 5Live news tweets: 3.04pm: My colleague Denis Campbell has compiled a list of the attendees at today's summit (and those not invited).

Indeed, he was specifically chosen because Brown considered that as a respected doctor he would help win round medics disgruntled by Labour's plans to close several hospitals in London, and replace them with controversial poly-clinics.HSJ editor Alastair McLellan (@HSJeditor) notes on Twitter:3.30pm: Labour leader Ed Miliband has attacked the PM's "bunker mentality" over the NHS during a hospital visit today - the Homerton in Hackney, East London.Here's the PA report of Miliband's speech:Meanwhile, it seems the health secretary Andrew Lansley is en route to his own hospital visist today - the Queen's hospital in Romford, Essex. If you at the hospital, as a worker, visitor or protestor please let us know what happens. Tweet me at @PatrickJButler or email at patrick.butler@guardian.co.uk3.53pm: In case you haven't seen the video of health secretary Andrew Lansley's kerfuffle with protesters outside Downing street, here it is: These images will define coverage of the Number 10 summit today.4.27pm: Sir Stephen Bubb, who represents charities who contract to provide public services, has revealed that the mood of the meeting in Number 10 today was that everyone should "get cracking" on the NHS reforms.Sir Stephen's organisation, Acevo, is a firm supporter of introducing more competition into the NHS, and vociferously opposed attempts by the former NHS secretary Andy Burnham to make the NHS the "preferred provider" of health services back in 2009-10.Here's the PA report: 4.43pm: More on who was at the summit and who wasn't (updating our 3.04pm list)According to Politics Home reporter Isabel Hardman (@IsabelHardman), we should add to the invitees:Among notable absentees were health minister Simon Burns, and, it seems, any Liberal Democrats. Hardman quotes the Prime minister's spokesman as saying:No criteria? What, none at all?4.53pm: While we are on the subject of lists, take a look at this compilation of MP's and Lords' financial interests in private healthcare, put together by the Social investigations blog.The blog asks: It would certainly be interesting to match those named on the list to their voting record on the bill.5.03pm: An interesting statement from Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, who was at the meeting at Number 10 today.Sir Richard makes it clear that the college is not "sitting on the fence": it is neither for or against the bill, and feels it is better to reform the NHS from inside the policy process than outside: He said: But as we speculated earlier, could the RCP be inching towards a more solid and decisive position on the bill? Next week (Monday 27 February) the RCP is holding an Extraordinary General Meeting for fellows of the RCP. There will be a debate on the Bill and a vote to decide if the RCP should survey its membership on the reforms.5.16pm: Hot on the heels of the RCP comes another statement from a Number 10 summit attendee, this time from Professor Terence Stephenson, President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.Stephenson says opposition to the bill among paediatricians is "increasingly hardening" and that there is "growing concern among our membership."Again, it suggests it its studiedly neutral position on the bill may change. It will make its formal position on the bill clear later this week.Here's the full statement: This could be a crucial decision.5.34pm: The government has admitted that it has failed to explain its NHS reforms, writes my colleague Nicholas Watt. Here's his report:5.55pm: Ok, that's it for today's NHS Reforms live blog. Here's a summary:I'll leave you with this picture, tweeted from outside Downing street this lunchtime by registered nurse Kathryn Anderson (@kaffando). She says:
