The most important story coming out of the University of Alabama this week has nothing to do with this Saturday's big Crimson Tide-Aggies football contest.Congratulations to the UA student newspaper, The Crimson White, for its investigation into what it describes as "the last bastion of segregation on campus: The UA greek system is still almost completely divided along racial lines."The University of Alabama probably is far from the only school where such discrimination exists, but several points make this story stand out: 1. the frankness with which some sorority members, particularly Alpha Gamma Delta member Melanie Gotz, discussed the injustice and 2. the student newspaper's thorough reporting.The Crimson White apparently has done prior work on this topic and proven that other Old South schools, for instance Ole Miss and Auburn, have gone much farther in integrating frats and sororities. (Of course, you wouldn't have to go much further to surpass UA, which apparently can point to only one black woman who has ever successfully pledged an old-line sorority.)The article documents how several young women tried to break the color barrier and were clearly rebuffed because of their race. Fifty years after Gov. George Wallace blocked the doors of the University of Alabama to two black students, the alumnae of UA sororities still sound like they think the only role for black women on campus is to serve as "The Help."Â
