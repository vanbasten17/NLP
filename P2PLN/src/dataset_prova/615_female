Here's a target that genuinely deserves our ire - the upcoming Channel 4 Wife Swap special: "the obedient wife edition". "Bonnie is a 'mindful' wife," coos the programme blurb. "If Bonnie starts to argue, Pete reminds her that she's not being mindful and she stops straight away." Bonnie is set to swap with Derenda from Doncaster, who scandalously allows partner Alani to cook and clean, and is presumably poised to unleash her wicked regime on poor old Pete. "Can she learn to be a mindful wife and take pride in pleasing her new husband? And   will Bonnie be able to show Alani the difference that having an obedient wife will make to his marriage?" One can only hope. Wake up, Alani - didn't anyone ever tell you what wives are for?  Stuck over what to get the little girl in your life for Christmas? You might shudder to discover near the top of her wishlist the new Barbie Girls CD, featuring the appropriately plasticky Rachel Stevens, Jennifer Ellison and Lolly. Of course, wise fairy godmothers know that the gift to give this season is the Guardian women's badge, in festive red or green (OK, blue if you wish).Email us at women@guardian.co.uk to sign 'em up young for the Barbie-bashing brigade, and we'll leave a badge under the tree for your chosen girl.
