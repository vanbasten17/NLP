The best part of being the moderator of the "Come Together" event was the multiple opportunities I had to observe the non-traditional thinkers who made up our panel — Mayor Mike Rawlings, Bishop T.D. Jakes, lawyer Liz Cedillo-Pereira and Paul Quinn President Michael Sorrell — problem-solve with one another — even prior to Tuesday night. It was inspiring to watch as the professional bonds grew among these four. For instance, the potential firepower of connections such as a Jakes-Sorrell initiative or how Liz Cedillo's pre-K challenge dovetails with Educational First Steps initiative, as explained by the mayor. The audience got a hint of that, particularly toward the last half of the conversation, but there's so much more to be mined.Starting this public "Come Together" conversation, with its refreshingly new and clear voices, is among the most important work our "Bridging Dallas' North-South Gap" has accomplished. Of course, it's only progress if we keep up the pressure. And readers can count on that.Next up — an Editorial and Viewpoints package on tomorrow's page out of the event, followed by columns in the coming weeks from the panelists.
