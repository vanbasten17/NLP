I'm glad to see the City Council members recommend asking the Landmark Commission to lead in creating a task force that would evaluate which of our downtown buildings are architecturally and historically significant and then create strategies for keeping them safe from the wrecking ball. Let's hope Dallas City Council follows up the strong words today with a vote next week to create the task force.Lots of questions will have to be resolved, according to several of those who watched today's hearing. (Poor excuse I realize, given my passion around this topic, but I was in a staff meeting instead of tuned into Channel 16.)Details surrounding a promised "waiting period" leave me somewhat perplexed: The waiting period that seems to be in play would involve the number of days between when when a business files notice that it wants to conduct a demolition and the date that it gets a permit to actually swing the wrecking ball.Even 10 days time, which seemed to some council members to be more generous than necessary, strikes me as not nearly long enough. This should be a period that's not simply a "cooling off" time — certainly, the owner knows by then with certainty that he wants to bring a building down — but rather a period of time that allows the appropriate (Landmark?) commission or task force to convene and discuss.I recognize that the rights of business owners are a large part of this conversation. But when I look at photos of buildings such as the one used at the top of this post, it seems that 30 days is not an unrealistic period to ask for.DMNer Elizabeth Findell's story out of today's briefing included these important numbers:There were 90 buildings listed as "contributing" to the Downtown National Register District in 2006, including 39 which are also within Dallas city historic districts and 38 which are not. The additional 13 were demolished or altered since the district was formed, according to the briefing.I hate to think of any more joining that Unlucky 13 list without historic experts having a thoughtful say.
